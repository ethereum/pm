00:20:29	Jared Wasinger:	It should be present for non-finalized blocks though
00:22:03	Barnabas:	a single malicous actor could trigger a chain to halt over 100M gas without eth/70
00:22:21	Dustin:	10MB still matters on CL gossip
00:22:53	Dustin:	yes 10MB is a hard limit right now
00:23:43	pk910:	receipts are more problematic than block payloads >10M.
a bigger block can't be broadcasted, but everyone generates the receipts themselves - except whenhitting sync
00:25:35	Ben Adams:	Call data price change is still important; because the size cap determining blocks rather than pricing distorts the gas market
00:26:13	Marius van der Wijden:	What was the point about the ef making noises again? Sorry I missed the sentence
00:27:07	Toni Wahrstätter:	It should be tested, yes, but we wouldn't go to 150M gas without the calldata pricing adjustment. After the calldata increase we have (a lot of) leeway again before getting close to 10mib.
00:27:10	Potuz:	Want to call attention that fine control on the max size is also actually needed for ePBS because it will determine the max broadcast time allocated.
00:27:19	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "What was the point a..."

00:27:59	Francesco:	I would agree, it’s not clear why we should have this extra cap
00:28:00	Potuz:	Replying to "Want to call attenti..."

yes, that seems to be a needed feature in this fork given the gas numbers that are being talked about

so what would you recommend for devnet-2 reduce to 100M?
00:29:11	Dustin:	Replying to "What was the point..."

Not suggesting otherwise but saying it impacts BAL planning
00:29:33	Dustin:	Replying to "What was the point..."

and means the existing overhead from Fusaka has to remain even though ePBS would remove most of it
00:29:34	Marius van der Wijden:	Replying to "What was the point a..." 

 Yep makes sense
00:29:45	Marius van der Wijden:	Reacted to It should be tested,... with "👍🏼"
00:29:51	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "It should be tested,..." 

 150M should be fine sice we have the rlp limit cap
00:30:04	Dustin:	Replying to "I would agree, it..."

ok, but that's at the earliest an H* point
00:30:11	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "It should be tested,..." 

 Maybe not. Not sure anymore if 10mib is actually a problem ot not
00:31:06	Ben Adams:	Replying to "It should be tested,..."

eth/70 is the missing part on going high (as mentioned receipts) https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7975
00:31:15	Francesco:	Replying to "I would agree, it’s ..."

Sure, just saying I think that is the right way to do it eventually

is this from some particular gh repo/branch?
00:41:51	Dustin:	Replying to "we have a  ethpand..."

or it is the gh org it looks like
00:42:10	Barnabas:	Replying to "we have a  ethpandao..."

its a fork of mine
00:42:18	Barnabas:	Replying to "we have a  ethpandao..."

I’ll check with marius if they can do an official upstream branch
00:42:35	Dustin:	Replying to "we have a  ethpand..."

that would be useful, not to rely on only a docker image
00:43:41	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "Want to call attenti..." 

 My current feeling is that it should just put as late into the slot as possible, ensuring max time for propagation while still ensuring our target gas limit can be executed (in the worst case) until the next slot.
00:43:51	Barnabas:	@FLCL mind giving us an update?
