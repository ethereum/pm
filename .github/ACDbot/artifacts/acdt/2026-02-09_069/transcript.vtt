00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:18.520
spencer-tb: Hey.

2
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.420
Leo Lara: go… Hello?

3
00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:55.499
Mario Vega: Hi everyone, let's just give one more minute to everyone before we can start. Thank you.

4
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:07.769
Mario Vega: I think we can get started.

5
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.020
Akash | ECH: Realize.

6
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:24.229
Mario Vega: Thank you, Akash. Good day, everyone. Welcome to ACT number 69. Today is February 9th of 2026. Yeah, let's just get started.

7
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:32.250
Mario Vega: First item in the agenda is Amsterdam, and the first sub-item is the log-level access list step number 2.

8
00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.329
Mario Vega: Stefan, would you want to go to the overview?

9
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.170
Mario Vega: Of the current status of the debit?

10
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.210
Mario Vega: Alright.

11
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:51.699
Mario Vega: mentions that the audio issues.

12
00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:29.600
Mario Vega: I think he's rejoining, let's just give… give it a minute.

13
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:34.889
Mario Vega: Anybody else wants to chime in in the meantime?

14
00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:37.550
Mario Vega: Regarding them, the two…

15
00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:58.459
Barnabas: Maybe I can give a quick update, while Stefan figures out his, mic issues. So, we launched the .NET last week, Friday.

16
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:08.009
Barnabas: We initially made a bit of a oopsie configuring the network, and that's why we had to make a 1000ml key deposit.

17
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:15.369
Barnabas: We initially configured the whole chain with only 1,000 deleters, and

18
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:23.370
Barnabas: Right now, I think we have some syncing issues on NetherMind. Netherland has been taking a look and trying to figure out,

19
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.629
Barnabas: What is the issue? Maybe they can give us an update next.

20
00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:39.030
Barnabas: As far as I know, everybody else should be okay. Oh, no, Nimbus ER as well. Nimbus EL with Lighthouse also seems to be, falling behind.

21
00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.820
Barnabas: So maybe they can also give us an update, but everyone else seems to be ahead.

22
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:46.160
Mario Vega: Thank you.

23
00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:51.230
Mario Vega: Anywhere from Nevermind, that can give an update.

24
00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:08.910
Marc: Yeah, sure, so, yeah, we're investigating this, syncing issue, and just generally working on our, BALS implementation and getting the rest of the, the test passing.

25
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:10.149
Marc: Yeah, that's right.

26
00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.619
Mario Vega: Alright, thank you. Anyone from Nimbus EL?

27
00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:19.300
Mario Vega: You can chime in?

28
00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:19.840
Dustin: Yeah.

29
00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:25.389
Dustin: Sure. So… This is the current…

30
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:33.489
Dustin: hypothesis, the current… it seems to be an issue with the finalized block I'm sort of relaying here, but,

31
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:34.490
Dustin: that…

32
00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:53.130
Dustin: the… for the block access list to be present for… that… Nimbus currently requires it to be present for the non-finalized blocks, and this is something that is apparently not necessarily the case. I will admit, I'm not the person who's been directly looking into the details of this, so…

33
00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:59.779
Dustin: But we are engaging here, and, that's… the, the current.

34
00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:05.519
Dustin: it's become… it's become a bit of a discussion of, like, what the correct behavior should be, basically.

35
00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:09.410
Dustin: And we can tweak this either way.

36
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:26.769
Mario Vega: Alright, is this something that you need to bring up in the, in the block-level access list specific discussion, or do you think it's a spec problem, or… is what I mean? Or is this a client issue?

37
00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:32.340
Dustin: I… I wouldn't re- I…

38
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:41.499
Dustin: My understanding is that the spec says what it… I don't… I don't think that we're sort of disputing the spec at this point. This is,

39
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:49.179
Dustin: this is our… so… I wouldn't say that quite yet. To Jared's point, yeah, so that Nimbus does require that.

40
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:58.170
Dustin: And… that they're not… It should be, yes, and… and the… Bye.

41
00:20:58.550 --> 00:20:59.320
Dustin: So…

42
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.750
Dustin: I… I… we may… it may get to the point where it's worth racing.

43
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:08.699
Dustin: In that sense.

44
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.010
Mario Vega: But.

45
00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.889
Dustin: But I don't think it's escalated that far yet.

46
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.879
Mario Vega: Alright, thank you. Thank you, Dustin.

47
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:26.820
Mario Vega: Stefan, I see that you're back online. We went through the details and the issues that we had. Do you have anything else, too, that you'd like to point out?

48
00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:35.469
Stefan Starflinger: Just maybe if clients could double-check if we can run with 150 million guests, I'm not sure if that was, discussed.

49
00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:41.650
Stefan Starflinger: So currently I've set the network to 150 million guests, but this might cause issues.

50
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:47.000
Stefan Starflinger: So it would be nice if clients could double-check this. I haven't heard back regarding that yet.

51
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:52.290
Stefan Starflinger: But otherwise, I might have to decrease it again, but I don't think it has caused any issues so far.

52
00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.210
Mario Vega: Yes, Tony.

53
00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:03.459
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, I'm not sure if the 10MB limit or any of those size limits, still matter.

54
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:09.140
Toni Wahrstätter: But with 150 million, we would definitely get over the 10MB uncomprompressed payload size.

55
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:18.839
Toni Wahrstätter: So, shouldn't be an issue if we just avoid, spamming big, big data transactions. So, just as a heads up, maybe let's avoid that.

56
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:26.639
Ben Adams: If it was over… 10 megabytes, then it would be an invalid block, because we've already put that.

57
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.620
Ben Adams: Oh, really?

58
00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:34.979
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, okay, this is good to know, because then we should definitely avoid it. Because as of 104, 105 million.

59
00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:37.049
Toni Wahrstätter: We can get over…

60
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:49.949
Toni Wahrstätter: 10 megabytes, if we don't include, and we didn't do so, we didn't include 7976, which would increase the call data cost, then we should be fine again, but for DEFNET2, we don't have that ERP yet, so…

61
00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.989
Toni Wahrstätter: Better, let's not put big data transactions on there.

62
00:22:55.020 --> 00:23:02.130
Ben Adams: I mean, it'll be fine, because they… you won't be able to build a block more than 10 megabytes, because it's an invalid block.

63
00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.260
Ben Adams: We put that in Fusaka.

64
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:07.630
Toni Wahrstätter: Right. Okay, perfect.

65
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:09.629
Stefan Starflinger: Is that something we should try out?

66
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:19.690
Ben Adams: Yeah, sure, but I mean, it does… It means that the,

67
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:27.109
Ben Adams: The… the blocks will be constrained by the cap on the megabyte size.

68
00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:33.290
Ben Adams: Which will skew the gas markets when it… it should actually be done on, you know, pricing.

69
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:43.900
Ben Adams: It's more of a safety measure. It's… ideally, we wouldn't be hitting the cap, but it should be safe to put whatever… go to whatever gas limit you want and not break the network.

70
00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:49.249
Stefan Starflinger: Okay, that's good to know. Maybe other clients, if they have some insight on this.

71
00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.499
Mario Vega: Jared, I saw you raise your hand. Do you have any…

72
00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:02.280
Mario Vega: Any, input, or was it just a, an.

73
00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:19.939
Jared Wasinger: Yeah, I was basically just gonna say that, like, we shouldn't be building, like Ben said, if we… if the clients do build a block that it goes over the size limit, it's a bad block, so…

74
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:29.400
Jared Wasinger: We shouldn't be avoiding parameters which would cause that to happen in invalid implementations, and that…

75
00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:36.870
Jared Wasinger: If that issue could be surfaced in a client, it should be tested here.

76
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:44.880
Mario Vega: Yeah, I agree.

77
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.890
Dustin: One consider…

78
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:57.590
Dustin: One consideration on that… Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt, I was waiting for a silence or a pause. Okay. One consideration there regarding… I mean, I don't fundamentally disagree, I mean, that, that, sure.

79
00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:05.750
Dustin: you know, the answer to don't create invalid blocks is don't create invalid blocks. But the… there's a…

80
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:09.450
Dustin: packaging point. Now, it becomes less acute with

81
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.790
Dustin: EPBS, but 2 points on EPBS.

82
00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:25.139
Dustin: One, the EF is still making noises about if it's, like, too delayed, it won't be there. Secondly, it doesn't completely remove this issue, because the envelope has some overhead.

83
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:34.989
Dustin: on the CL side. This is what that structure is called over there. That contains execution, payload and stuff, and the ball stuff as well.

84
00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:40.210
Dustin: So, what this means is that there's,

85
00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:49.489
Dustin: a pay… a block that looks valid from the EL side that is not valid on the CL side. It cannot be broadcast, or etc. on the CL side.

86
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:50.250
Ben Adams: That's right.

87
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.320
Ben Adams: The cap includes a margin for the CL.

88
00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:59.750
Ben Adams: So it's… the EL… I don't know if it's, like, the EL can only produce an 8MB block.

89
00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.150
Ben Adams: So that this CL component. Okay.

90
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.830
Ben Adams: An envelope around it.

91
00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:09.570
Dustin: Okay, that's… and that… that… that addresses slash resolves that, that's fine then. Okay.

92
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:15.869
Ben Adams: Yeah, that's in… that's already in Fisaka, so, it's live on my net.

93
00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:25.010
Ben Adams: But obviously, we still need… we still need adjustments to the call data pricing, because

94
00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:33.759
Ben Adams: We don't want the… the size cap to determine the blocks. We want the pricing, because otherwise the gas market is…

95
00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:36.350
Ben Adams: Because… All wrong.

96
00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:43.970
Ben Adams: If you're… if you're determining pricing by the cap, rather than You know, the actual prices.

97
00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:53.080
Dustin: Yeah, no, I agree. I want to address Marius has questioned a moment, too, because he was obviously responding to a thing I just said.

98
00:26:53.260 --> 00:27:00.079
Dustin: And, but the… and maybe mumbled my way through, I don't know. But the,

99
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:16.760
Dustin: I… but in terms of ensuring the gas market is not… not distorted by this, I think the more principled solution that I think actually… I'm not saying this will have this in Trusaka… we don't have it in Trusaka, I'm not saying we'll have it in Amsterdam, I'm not… this is not necessarily a near-term thing.

100
00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:22.199
Dustin: But the most principled solution I saw was, I think, actually Yossix,

101
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:29.200
Dustin: yes, also Nimbus, but, you know, you know, I disagree on plenty of stuff. That… that we're…

102
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:49.380
Dustin: the gas price, and where the blocks… the max block size is determined by the gas price. It's a function… there are mutual sort of functions of each other in a certain sense, and the… there are variations of this idea. But the idea is that you don't have this other kind of cap that… you change one parameter, then oops, you hit some limit. All right,

103
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:55.829
Dustin: And that avoids, avoids us, but we don't have it yet, and we don't have it for Amsterdam.

104
00:27:56.020 --> 00:28:03.150
Dustin: But the, the deadline, oh yeah, somebody was… right, right, right, that was asked and answered.

105
00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:12.059
Dustin: Yes. Basically, if EPBS looked like it was missing deadlines, then… then there were noises made on other ACD calls about dropping EPBS.

106
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:25.920
Dustin: And I only bring that up here to say, well, that any planning now around block size limits or overhead or something can't take into account yet the reduced overhead from splitting the CL

107
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.540
Dustin: block and the EL payload. Anyway, yeah.

108
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:30.650
Mario Vega: Yeah, Dragon?

109
00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:41.390
Dragan Rakita: Yeah, I had a question about hitting that limit, size limit, 10 megabytes in the blog building.

110
00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:44.910
Dragan Rakita: How is that done on NetherMye's side?

111
00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:50.979
Dragan Rakita: Does it basically check the size after the block is built and validates it?

112
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:56.849
Ben Adams: We check it as we're adding transactions, but it's not too…

113
00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:03.150
Dragan Rakita: So that includes both the transactions and receipts, and both.

114
00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:08.960
Ben Adams: I'm not sure what we're doing with… False.

115
00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.980
Dragan Rakita: Yeah, both problematic, prob- prob- probably.

116
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.720
Dragan Rakita: Either way, just wanted to…

117
00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:30.279
Dragan Rakita: focus a little bit here, because it can be… it's prob… every client probably has their case around this, how they, like, measure the block size while they're building it. It's very easy to, like, check it after it's built, but…

118
00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:38.830
Dragan Rakita: Invalidated, or just stopping at some point of time after some intersection, the block is big enough.

119
00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:41.430
Dragan Rakita: It's probably very familiar-specific.

120
00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:52.199
Dragan Rakita: So, either way, if we can go to, like, 100 million guess, and we are sure that we don't go over 10 megabytes with that.

121
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:54.609
Dragan Rakita: Just go with, like, 100 million.

122
00:29:54.760 --> 00:30:00.720
Dragan Rakita: And then bumped it again when proper IP for it could lands.

123
00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:05.990
Mario Vega: Thank you. Maurice?

124
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:16.000
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, I wanted to respond to… The point that,

125
00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:21.860
Marius van der Wijden: I keep blanking on the name…

126
00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:28.840
Marius van der Wijden: That someone was making that, this extra cap, should be,

127
00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:38.570
Marius van der Wijden: should not be there, or should, or it impacts the… impacts the gas calculator… the gas calculator, and that is…

128
00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:48.089
Marius van der Wijden: Yes, but the idea of this cap was that this is like a stopgap solution. This should never be hit.

129
00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:55.460
Marius van der Wijden: In practice, And even now, it should not be hit.

130
00:30:55.830 --> 00:31:00.409
Marius van der Wijden: Except if there is, adversarial

131
00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:09.570
Marius van der Wijden: transaction load on the network, and I think it is fine to simulate that on… on… on DEFNET2.

132
00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:16.440
Marius van der Wijden: And… In theory, nothing PM should be broken with it, but,

133
00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:21.540
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, if we… if we want to… if we want to focus on…

134
00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:30.450
Marius van der Wijden: on, having this kind of a stable network, and not break it, then I don't… I don't know if there's really a need to.

135
00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:35.960
Marius van der Wijden: test this on Bell.net too, but as…

136
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:40.580
Marius van der Wijden: as Tony said, that we…

137
00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:45.020
Marius van der Wijden: We will increase the,

138
00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:57.359
Marius van der Wijden: We will increase this, the call data size anyway, or we will need to increase the call data size anyway if we want to go significantly beyond 100 million GAS.

139
00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:04.150
Marius van der Wijden: So… I think… doesn't… Yeah.

140
00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:09.269
Marius van der Wijden: Doesn't really make sense… sense for me now to kind of…

141
00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:12.050
Marius van der Wijden: Test this condition that is…

142
00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:28.880
Marius van der Wijden: that we are hopefully never going to hit, on a DevNet, just to test it, and then potentially break the DevNet and kind of stall our… our progress on testing these other things that we should be testing on this DevNet.

143
00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:42.819
Mario Vega: Thank you. So yeah, it seems like the sentiment or consensus is to lower the gas limit for now. Stefan, is that an issue, or should we be okay?

144
00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.469
Stefan Starflinger: That's not a problem. We can lower it.

145
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:59.670
Stefan Starflinger: It's just, the request came in in the breakout call, to raise the gas limit so that we can increase the state, so it's easier to do some benchmarking. That's basically the motivation for it.

146
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:12.689
Mario Vega: Yeah, I see two… two numbers in the chat, it's 70 million and 100 million. Should we decide on one, or push it to 70 and then push it to 100? Is that okay?

147
00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:13.530
Mario Vega: Yeah, Tony?

148
00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:14.300
Stefan Starflinger: Yep.

149
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:15.260
Mario Vega: Okay.

150
00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:21.139
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, no, I just wanted to agree, I think it's fine. We can, we can go with either.

151
00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:32.370
Toni Wahrstätter: It would be great if we, at least at the latest until Definitely, if we have, like, a clear understanding of where this new 10MB limit applies, I guess.

152
00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:50.220
Toni Wahrstätter: the neutron, the new, eFlog EAP might also affect us, because suddenly receipts are also a problem, it seems like, from the jet. So it would be great if we're definitely… if we are ready to increase it without having to fear that something in DevP2P might struggle.

153
00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:54.270
Mario Vega: Thank you. Ben?

154
00:33:55.070 --> 00:34:00.529
Ben Adams: I think the logs issue's around 107?

155
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:03.259
Ben Adams: Oh, we should be fine, not 100.

156
00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:20.939
Mario Vega: Sounds good, thank you. Tony, you still have… you're having your hand up? okay, thanks. Alright, is there anything else anyone wants to raise regarding block load access list definite 2?

157
00:34:21.499 --> 00:34:23.369
Mario Vega: Shall we move on to EPBS?

158
00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:29.339
Stefan Starflinger: Nothing else from my side, I think Barnabas said everything.

159
00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:30.829
Mario Vega: Perfect.

160
00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:37.550
Toni Wahrstätter: Maybe just to add, we have a breaker call on Wednesday again, where we discuss two small changes to the specs again.

161
00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:41.939
Toni Wahrstätter: Very minor things, but still worth, to highlight.

162
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:52.260
Mario Vega: Excellent, thank you, Tony. Thank you, Stefan. Alright, let's move on into EPVS.NET Zero.

163
00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:59.689
Mario Vega: Justin, is it you the go-to person for this topic? Do you know the updates, or should we go into the clients for updates?

164
00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:03.710
Justin Traglia: I guess I am the go-to person, but yeah, we should go to the clients first.

165
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:11.360
Mario Vega: Excellent. Alright, yeah, yeah, let's go, clients, first. So, anyone from Prism?

166
00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.630
Mario Vega: Can give an update on EPBS?

167
00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:30.999
Potuz: I'm not sure if Terrence is here, who would be the most appropriate one, but, same as last week, we are just merging, and implementation is picking up space, pace.

168
00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.700
Potuz: I should have 4 choice ready in one or two days.

169
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:46.470
Potuz: And most of the… most of the core transition function is already, open for review, and people are merging PRs.

170
00:35:46.730 --> 00:36:00.240
Potuz: What's missing is the API, and this is already, like, the team is onboarded mostly on that, people are writing that, and the blockchain package to sync, which, I think I'll take care of that after Fortress.

171
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:06.919
Mario Vega: Alright, thank you. Anyone from Deku who wishes to give an update?

172
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:20.349
Stefan Bratanov: Yeah, sure, so… Basically passing the specs test from Alpha 2,

173
00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:24.640
Stefan Bratanov: And, without the frog choice test, and,

174
00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:29.210
Stefan Bratanov: We got a couple of more people working on… Gloss now, so…

175
00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:37.900
Stefan Bratanov: Yeah, hopefully soon we can interrupt between each other, and then… Definite Zero at some point.

176
00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:43.020
Mario Vega: Great, thanks. Anywhere from Lighthouse?

177
00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:56.739
Mario Vega: Alright, are anyone from Nimbus? Just to give me a win?

178
00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.690
Mario Vega: Mimbus or Lighthouse for EPVS updates,

179
00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.449
Mario Vega: Anyone who wishes to chime in? Yep.

180
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:21.099
Dustin: Okay, well, sure, I'm not sure if I'm the best person to do this, but I'm sure. But basically, we are,

181
00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:32.159
Dustin: We're merging, yeah, kind of along the line of what Prism… what POTUS… what POTUS was saying about what Prism was doing. so we have, I mean.

182
00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:39.860
Dustin: I… I think the… the big PR that we're… the Alpha.2 spec stuff is… has been…

183
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:48.449
Dustin: kind of looking… finding various edge cases in that and the like, actually in the specs more than the, than the PR itself.

184
00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:56.800
Dustin: but… and the test, but in any case, we… that works. We can… we can… I think the plan is to merge that imminently, and then…

185
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:58.999
Dustin: And I'll… we have the full

186
00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:18.679
Dustin: we're passing the test, we have the full state transition function, we, in theory, are broadcasting everything. also, this is a request for clarification, I guess, is that in one of the other ACD calls, there was a comment about that

187
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.259
Dustin: DevNet Zero would not be primarily about fork choice.

188
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:32.139
Dustin: But so that wouldn't be, like, the target for fork choice. That, that would be, I guess, what, DevNet1 or something, 2, I'm not sure, whatever. Is that true?

189
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:36.259
Dustin: What is the…

190
00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:38.340
Barnabas: That was, like, an almost

191
00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:56.659
Barnabas: Yeah, like, ideally, we're not going to have many forks on DevNet 0, and we're not gonna trigger any edge case scenarios, we just want to try to test basic interop between the clients, and then later on, once we have, like, an answer done DevNet2 or whatever, then we can go really into the…

192
00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:59.180
Barnabas: Harder edge cases.

193
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:11.900
Dustin: Okay, because basically, our plan is to not really prioritize, the fork toy stuff at that, for DevNet Zero none. And I just wanted to

194
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:17.139
Dustin: Confirmed that, fine. Alright, otherwise, we're… we're getting fairly close to…

195
00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:22.039
Dustin: Close, closer, closer to ready, I would say, for this.

196
00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:24.779
Dustin: Not… not any huge missing parts.

197
00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:26.549
Mario Vega: Great, thank you.

198
00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:30.740
Dustin: I do have one question.

199
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:40.889
Dustin: This is… I promise, a question, and then I'll let you… the meeting continue, but is we are looking for a way to test this. Is there a way of kurtosis, the same way that,

200
00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:47.410
Dustin: And for… Barnabas has, has, gotten the CLs.

201
00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:51.239
Dustin: To implement, you know, a fake fork.

202
00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:54.369
Dustin: That… that will probably never exist for… for…

203
00:39:54.510 --> 00:40:00.599
Dustin: For balls, which, fine, okay, that means balls can be tested more easily, but the converse of this.

204
00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:03.850
Dustin: something… is there… is there an EL?

205
00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:08.060
Dustin: analog here, so we can, like, kurtosis test this stuff.

206
00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:12.089
ashah: And then I remembered you said.

207
00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:16.520
Dustin: Okay.

208
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:20.099
Mario Vega: I think that was, there was a,

209
00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:23.220
Mario Vega: That wasn't intentional. Doesn't sorry.

210
00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:23.620
Dustin: He's…

211
00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:25.099
Mario Vega: Clarify your question again.

212
00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:37.980
Dustin: Yeah, oh, kind of, I think Barnabas may have responded to this already, like, EPBS7 at 0. Basically, looking for an EL branch to do something, like, whether it's kurtosis, but in general, an EL to pair with the CLs.

213
00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:39.070
Dustin: For testing.

214
00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.859
Barnabas: That's my, my, my personally biggest concern. Sorry, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

215
00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.470
Barnabas: That should be the image to use right now.

216
00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.160
Barnabas: What do you?

217
00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:48.720
Dustin: Okay.

218
00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:57.259
Dustin: Okay. Because that's otherwise just my biggest concern, it's like, well, we have all this stuff theoretically there, but, you know, yeah. Alright, great.

219
00:40:57.860 --> 00:40:58.550
Mario Vega: Alright.

220
00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:05.360
Mario Vega: Thank you, Dustin. Lastly, anyone from Lodestar who wishes to chime in regarding the updates?

221
00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:24.140
nflaig: Yeah, so we… we are passing the Alpha 2 spec tests, and have, implemented the stateful, block production APIs, and then NC can give an update on our fork choice progress. But basically, we are passing all, spec tests, so…

222
00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.910
NC: Right, for choice.

223
00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.020
NC: We have a couple, refactoring

224
00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:36.579
NC: on our EPVS book choice implementation, so we're… Scan one step closer.

225
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:40.269
NC: to get the pro-choice PR merged.

226
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:47.010
NC: And… we also have a, a PR draft, which is a, first…

227
00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.860
NC: Draft implementation of updating our state cache and checkpoint cache.

228
00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:53.989
NC: to work with TPBS?

229
00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.480
Mario Vega: Alright, thank you.

230
00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:09.070
Mario Vega: I think that's every client. Justin, do you have anything else that we should be considering here, or…

231
00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.679
Mario Vega: Should we move on?

232
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:21.180
Justin Traglia: Mmm, not much. We are working on adding more tests for Gloss, and there are a few open PRs, but I'm not sure if it makes sense to discuss them, unless we want to.

233
00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:25.490
Justin Traglia: Such as the variable PTC deadline PR.

234
00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:29.710
Justin Traglia: Bye, Francesco. Are there any updates there? Do we still want to merge this?

235
00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:42.469
Francesco: At least not for me. There were some concerns that had been raised by Anders about more, like, future compatibility of this, which I don't think there's…

236
00:42:44.360 --> 00:43:00.109
Francesco: you know, really anything to say about, in the sense there's not really progress on this question. Other than that, I'm not sure. I haven't really had time to think about it more deeply. Like, right now, I wouldn't feel comfortable going ahead and merging it, but…

237
00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:04.379
Justin Traglia: Okay. We'll continue to work on it then.

238
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.929
Justin Traglia: And that's pretty much it. I think every other PR we can discuss offline.

239
00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:10.770
Mario Vega: Excellent. Thank you so much.

240
00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:16.190
Mario Vega: Alright, let's move on. We have 4 other topics in gas limit testing.

241
00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:28.009
Mario Vega: Yeah, let's just get going. The F70, updates, the new protocol, do we have, a go-to person who can speak a little bit more about it?

242
00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:33.349
Mario Vega: I think if that… now I'm not mistaken, it's a FLCL, right?

243
00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:37.580
Mario Vega: the person to… Discuss this?

244
00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:50.869
Mario Vega: Or do we have any other go-to person for F17?

245
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.869
Mario Vega: Discussion topic?

246
00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:08.089
Mario Vega: So, I can…

247
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:18.270
Fabio Di Fabio: say that in Bezu, the ETH17 implementation is, Ready.

248
00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:21.419
Fabio Di Fabio: And I'm starting to test it.

249
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:27.459
Fabio Di Fabio: I need to also start to test it against other clients that I implemented it.

250
00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:33.949
Fabio Di Fabio: Mmm… Yeah, it's taking a bit more time, because we are also refactoring the sync.

251
00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:40.630
Fabio Di Fabio: Part of the code, but… Otherwise, the implementation should be fine.

252
00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:44.220
Fabio Di Fabio: On our website.

253
00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.180
Mario Vega: Thank you. Maurice?

254
00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:51.799
Marius van der Wijden: Yes, as I have already wrote in the chat.

255
00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:55.950
Marius van der Wijden: We are… PK is also trying to test it.

256
00:44:56.060 --> 00:45:05.310
Marius van der Wijden: We have implementations for, BISO, Nevermind, and Geth. Maybe, PK, you can quickly talk about the state?

257
00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.290
Marius van der Wijden: off testing?

258
00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:13.230
pk910: That's the E70 test, right?

259
00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:14.170
Marius van der Wijden: Yep.

260
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:17.949
pk910: Yep. Yeah, we've prepared a,

261
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:22.319
pk910: Kurtosis pack, or, Kurtosis config for it,

262
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:32.069
pk910: In theory, it should work that we are sending… that we are generating blocks with receipts bigger than 10MB, and

263
00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:39.930
pk910: We assumed that clients that do not support ETH70 at that point are unable to sync.

264
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:41.240
pk910: this chain.

265
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:48.659
pk910: Right now, they are still able to sync, we are not fully sure why, but, yeah, it's ongoing.

266
00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:59.379
pk910: Path forward is probably that we are probably set up a full testnet for it, because kurtosis has some limitations in regards to changing flags and restarting clients.

267
00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:01.950
pk910: yeah.

268
00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:16.770
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, I think the problem is that you can always full-sync the chain, right? Like, you never sync the receipts when you full sync the chain, you only sync the receipts when you are snap-syncing, so…

269
00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:27.769
pk910: Yep, that makes sense, yeah. But even then, we had problems with restarting GAT with SnapSync on a…

270
00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.959
pk910: Kratos is DevNet, so…

271
00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:32.889
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, it probably just makes…

272
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:35.869
pk910: More sense to set up a full testnet for that.

273
00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.070
pk910: That's all.

274
00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:46.639
Marius van der Wijden: That's a different problem, Geth is bad at snap-syncing a chain that is not Alive yet, or starting from…

275
00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:48.639
Marius van der Wijden: Like, I think from zero.

276
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:51.590
Marius van der Wijden: And then snap syncing.

277
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:56.259
Marius van der Wijden: Yes. Could we prioritize this?

278
00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:03.999
Marius van der Wijden: ETH70 DevNet a bit, because, this is the biggest blocker to scaling right now.

279
00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:07.469
Marius van der Wijden: Without this, we cannot go beyond.

280
00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:08.990
Marius van der Wijden: AP3.

281
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:13.869
Marius van der Wijden: Brilliant, so… Would be nice to get this over the finish line.

282
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:25.290
Marius van der Wijden: And we… we need to… we… we need to wait until the fork point anyway, because all clients need… or all nodes need to be updated.

283
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:32.180
Marius van der Wijden: If we want to increase the mainnet gas limit, so, the… Yeah.

284
00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:36.569
Marius van der Wijden: The sooner we get to it, the more time we have for other

285
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:47.660
Marius van der Wijden: EAPs. We can't just schedule it for definite 3. I think that would be possible as well. But maybe…

286
00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:52.339
Marius van der Wijden: But just testing it in isolation would be actually, better.

287
00:47:55.050 --> 00:48:00.320
Mario Vega: With designated isolation, do you mean, like, a sole tablet just for this?

288
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.819
Marius van der Wijden: Yes, I think.

289
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:08.299
Mario Vega: Alright, because Barnabas is suggesting that we add it to DevNet3, so that's…

290
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:11.390
Mario Vega: Something you don't agree with?

291
00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.060
Marius van der Wijden: I…

292
00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:33.389
Marius van der Wijden: I personally think it would be easier and nicer to test this in isolation, and then later on, maybe add it to Definite 3, or Definite 4, or whenever, at some point, like, add it into the definite cycle, than starting the first test on the definite cycle.

293
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:41.069
Marius van der Wijden: On the definite, on, on the, bell, definite cycle, because…

294
00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:46.580
Marius van der Wijden: We have so many interacting peaches now, and

295
00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:50.219
Marius van der Wijden: It makes it… doesn't make it easy to…

296
00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:56.079
Marius van der Wijden: Kind of merge the stuff upstream if we keep piling stuff on top of each other.

297
00:48:57.490 --> 00:48:59.480
Mario Vega: PK, Barnabas, any thoughts on this?

298
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:05.240
Barnabas: Yeah, we can get the new DevNet up and running probably mid-week.

299
00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:08.479
Barnabas: Or even earlier.

300
00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:26.539
Mario Vega: Alright, I think the only missing bit from this is the client's readiness. Should we discuss this async and just, reach out to you, Barnabas, or PK for the clients that are ready for them to be included? Is that okay?

301
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:32.650
Mario Vega: Okay, sounds good.

302
00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.339
Mario Vega: Alright, thanks, thanks for this.

303
00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:47.829
Mario Vega: Let's move on. So the next topic is benchmarking updates. So for this, Camille and also Luis left a comment on the agenda.

304
00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:51.669
Mario Vega: Camille, would you like… let me see if Camille's online.

305
00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:53.720
Mario Vega: Yeah, Camille, would you like to go first?

306
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:59.910
Kamil Chodoła: Yeah, I'm not sure if I left any comment. Are you sure it was me?

307
00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:02.270
Mario Vega: No, sorry, sorry, I was mistaken.

308
00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:05.829
Mario Vega: Do you wish to give an update, or should we go to Louis?

309
00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:06.450
Kamil Chodoła: Yeah.

310
00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:14.299
Kamil Chodoła: Yeah, I can give an update then. So, currently we are focusing super heavily on all of the benchmarks for repricings.

311
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:26.769
Kamil Chodoła: I guess we have already a lot of test cases, especially compute part is well covered, and we generated tests. Maria had a first pass over the compute scenarios, and we have some first numbers.

312
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:35.359
Kamil Chodoła: For stateful, tests are still coming, like, Carlos Perez made a lot of tests together with Johan, and right now we are generating them.

313
00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:41.159
Kamil Chodoła: Also, we spent quite a lot of time together with, who it was.

314
00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:48.959
Kamil Chodoła: forgot the name of EF… Rafael, working on Benchmarkor together with,

315
00:50:49.100 --> 00:51:07.460
Kamil Chodoła: Gas Benchmarks generated tests to see if everything's working properly. Also made a extra work to make the reorgs working here, so it is easier to test basically any test, to run any test, instead of running all of them in proper order to reach one specific scenario, and it works well right now.

316
00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:25.360
Kamil Chodoła: And from important updates, Marching made a draft implementation of testing endpoint inside Nethermind, and we integrated it into GAS Benchmarks, and it proves that it is much better than just using some hacked version of NetherMind. Test generation is much, much faster, much more flexible.

317
00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:32.400
Kamil Chodoła: And yeah, also thanks to that endpoint, we were able to make this reorging mechanism on top of stateful tests working.

318
00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:40.240
Kamil Chodoła: So yeah, so right now we are focusing again on regeneration of the tests, waiting for new infra to run the tests on top of mainnet and Bloatnet.

319
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:48.800
Kamil Chodoła: And once that will be done and traced, Maria will give a second round of analysis. Hopefully, it will be ready by…

320
00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:50.490
Kamil Chodoła: Tomorrow.

321
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:55.699
Kamil Chodoła: with data collected. But the blocker right now is the infrastructure.

322
00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:06.930
Mario Vega: Got it. Thanks, thanks for the update. We do have a benchmark demo, but I will leave that until after gas pricing updates.

323
00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:14.899
Mario Vega: And lastly, for the benchmarking updates, Luis, do you want to expand a little bit on your comment in the agenda? Is that okay?

324
00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.969
Louis: Yes, can you hear me?

325
00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:18.340
Mario Vega: Yes.

326
00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:26.110
Louis: Okay, I would like to quickly share some status updates from the Steel team regarding the benchmarking progress.

327
00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:33.880
Louis: So the first thing is that we have published our latest benchmark release, which now supports Osaka Fork.

328
00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:51.820
Louis: And the second thing is that, we have updated our benchmark documentation, which includes the current project structure of yours benchmark, and different modes of benchmark we're currently supporting, and the corresponding test generation workflow.

329
00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:58.560
Louis: And also, it includes the instruction on how to run and write the benchmark tests.

330
00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:02.930
Louis: I have shared these two resources to the chat.

331
00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:08.489
Louis: Please feel free to give us feedback, and let me know if there is anything unclear.

332
00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:11.050
Louis: That's it for my site. Thank you.

333
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:13.650
Mario Vega: Excellent, thank you.

334
00:53:13.930 --> 00:53:24.180
Mario Vega: All right, let's move on. Maria, the next, I think you're the go-to person for, gas repricing. Would you like to give us an overview update?

335
00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:28.939
Maria Silva: Sure, happy to. Can you hear me alright?

336
00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:30.580
Mario Vega: Yes, perfectly, thank you.

337
00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:42.399
Maria Silva: Okay, so, we did the first breakout last week. The notes and summary is already on forecast. If you want to,

338
00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:50.599
Maria Silva: review it. Also, If you want to keep updated on what we are working on these,

339
00:53:51.220 --> 00:54:07.279
Maria Silva: we have these to-do lists that I'm sharing in the chat, and I'm keeping it as much up-to-date as possible, so it has a description of all the work streams, including benchmarking and the general timeline for when we need.

340
00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:12.939
Maria Silva: things. The key updates there was on…

341
00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:21.740
Maria Silva: the compute repricing, so 7904, there's the… the… the PR for the new EIP.

342
00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:31.860
Maria Silva: numbers are there, and this is based on the first round of benchmarks that Camille was talking about previously, so we already have the set of

343
00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:51.460
Maria Silva: operations that we are suggesting to reprice under that TIP, and also, some preliminary numbers that then still need to be updated once we have, benchmarking for block-level access list-optimized clients. So those numbers are not yet final.

344
00:54:51.650 --> 00:55:07.609
Maria Silva: And then, on all the other EIPs, so on the state access EIP, we still need the work on the benchmarks to be completed, so that we can have the first numbers. Once we do that, we'll update the EIP as well.

345
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:11.180
Maria Silva: For the state growth EIP,

346
00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:24.609
Maria Silva: So, AT37, we've started to do, more work on, on the specs and, and answering, some open questions on how to implement some details.

347
00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:32.669
Maria Silva: And we have… Francesco did an initial pass on the specs, Spencer is starting to work on,

348
00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:42.119
Maria Silva: on, picking up from Francesco and making sure that everything is implemented, and I'm also, updating the EIP.

349
00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:56.219
Maria Silva: to give more information on the actual details of how we do the multidimensional metering in that TIP, so the… I will, the PR is not open yet, but I'm… I'm almost finishing up, so it should be ready by the end of the day.

350
00:55:56.310 --> 00:55:58.800
Maria Silva: For…

351
00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:11.409
Maria Silva: the ETH transfers EIP, so to 780, we, we still, will do… we still need to do some benchmarking there to… to get the final numbers as well.

352
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:14.819
Maria Silva: And we have,

353
00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:29.170
Maria Silva: some work starting as well on specs and tests. And finally, for the data EIPs, so increasing the costs, Tony has done the PR on the specs.

354
00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:43.549
Maria Silva: And, so I think that that EIP is the one that is more advanced, and also Tony published a proposal to change the base numbers to 6464 for the, the

355
00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:50.479
Maria Silva: the worst-case blocks, when the blocks are using most call data. So this should also help,

356
00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:55.109
Maria Silva: Reduce the… The worst blocks there.

357
00:56:55.130 --> 00:57:02.560
Maria Silva: So yeah, so this is the general overview. If you have any questions, just let me know, and…

358
00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:17.440
Maria Silva: yeah, we'll try to keep the to-dos as much updated as possible, so you are also aware of what's happening. And if you have any comments, if you want to work more on these EIPs, just, you can come to the breakout, which will be next week, Wednesday.

359
00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:20.909
Maria Silva: And, yeah, we're happy to… to have you there.

360
00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:28.669
Mario Vega: Excellent, thank you, thank you so much. Any questions for Maria regarding the gas reprisings?

361
00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:42.460
Mario Vega: Alright, if not, thank you, Maria, again. Oh, Dragon.

362
00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:53.400
Dragan Rakita: Sorry, I'm a bit late on raising the hand. Do you have plan on bot DevNet? Do we expect this to, like, land?

363
00:57:54.510 --> 00:58:03.190
Dragan Rakita: Or basically, is it expected to, like, implement everything for the DevNet, or can be partially implemented, or something like that?

364
00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:04.939
Dragan Rakita: It seems to look.

365
00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:05.280
Maria Silva: Yeah.

366
00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:07.540
Dragan Rakita: A lot of changes there, so, yeah.

367
00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:23.780
Maria Silva: Yeah, so that's… that's a great question, and I think it's also a point I raised in… as a comment that I wanted to get to, and I'm not sure if this is the right place to have the discussion, but in my mind, the ideal thing would be

368
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:41.350
Maria Silva: And I have this, so if you open the to-dos, I have a general timeline of when things will be ready. And so, for all the EIPs, excluding the state growth EIPs, so 1837, so that one we could do earlier, for all the others.

369
00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:46.139
Maria Silva: They do depend on benchmarking things and their block level.

370
00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:54.060
Maria Silva: least, optimized clients, and so we only expect to have the final numbers by the end of March. So that means that

371
00:58:54.550 --> 00:59:08.589
Maria Silva: it would make sense to add those EIPs after we have those final numbers. However, for 8037, given that first this is the most complex EIP implementation-wise.

372
00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:15.260
Maria Silva: I think it would be better to have it sooner, so ideally we would have it in the next DevNet.

373
00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:17.860
Maria Silva: And then we could add all the others.

374
00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:33.959
Maria Silva: in the DevNet after. And I think that would be okay, because all of the others are mostly doing just perimeter changes. An open question is what we do with 2780, which also has some implementation logic.

375
00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:40.199
Maria Silva: Not just the… Changing the parameters, and then we could discuss, maybe it may say…

376
00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:48.719
Maria Silva: makes sense to add them both in DevNet 3, and then leave the… all the others for the next DevNet.

377
00:59:48.830 --> 01:00:05.980
Maria Silva: I think for the data repricing, it may also make sense to add it a bit earlier, just because of the discussion we had previously, so it would help us test higher block limits without getting the bottleneck of the… of the size of the block.

378
01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:19.630
Maria Silva: But yeah, so this is, the general… I think what would make sense to do is essentially do, the state growth EIP as soon as possible, and then we have a bit more leeway for the others, and,

379
01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:26.780
Maria Silva: especially for the compute reprice and the state access reprice, I think we should only add it after March.

380
01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:31.379
Dragan Rakita: Okay, sounds good.

381
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:34.680
Dragan Rakita: So, internal,

382
01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:47.110
Dragan Rakita: We depend… state taxes and state creation depend on the ball, basically on the ball data, how it will behave, so we need to wait there. Exactly. Another IP needs

383
01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:53.350
Dragan Rakita: Could be implemented before, but it will depend on, like, Yep. If…

384
01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:58.110
Dragan Rakita: Clients have time, or basically… organization in general.

385
01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.560
Dragan Rakita: Okay, cool. Exactly.

386
01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.829
Maria Silva: Exactly, exactly, yeah.

387
01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:10.780
Maria Silva: But I would argue to prioritize it, like, to make it the state growth EIP, so 8037, to make it a priority for the next DevNet.

388
01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:20.509
Dragan Rakita: Yeah, that's the state… State creation gas cost increase.

389
01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:22.980
Maria Silva: Exactly, exactly. Okay, cool.

390
01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:38.390
Mario Vega: Alright, but yeah, no, I don't think there's, this is the time for making a decision, because we're still, like, running DevNet 2, so I think if we can bring up that discussion at a later call, it would be…

391
01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:42.840
Mario Vega: It would be great, just to… See how we can coordinate.

392
01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:44.250
Mario Vega: Alright.

393
01:01:44.430 --> 01:02:00.309
Mario Vega: Thank you. So then, thanks, Maria, and thanks, thanks, Rogan. Yeah, for the last topic of today, we have a benchmarker update, and demo, sorry. I think Rafael is the go-to person here? Yeah, thank you.

394
01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:01.650
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Yes.

395
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:12.420
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Yeah, I mean, it has been mentioned already by Camille, Benchmarker, so what is Benchmarker? In the past, like, NetherMite has been running these gas benchmarks.

396
01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:21.770
Rafael Matias (skylenet): And Benchmarker is highly inspired by this, like, at least on the approach. How to basically execute EL benchmarks to, like.

397
01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:40.279
Rafael Matias (skylenet): verify the MGAS per second, and so on, and see which tests are, like, the slowest, and so on. So we created Benchmarker, which is under the ETH PandaOps Benchmarker repo. It is able to… so one thing it does not do is, like, the test generation, so that

398
01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:43.140
Rafael Matias (skylenet): this up to the, EAST team.

399
01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:54.699
Rafael Matias (skylenet): to EAST, so it can consume, like, there are East fixtures for benchmarking, it can consume those fixtures, it can also just consume raw JSON files that, like, do engine calls.

400
01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.090
Rafael Matias (skylenet): new payloads and FCUs.

401
01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:02.729
Rafael Matias (skylenet): And yeah, then it… you basically have, like, these set of tests.

402
01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:09.970
Rafael Matias (skylenet): For example, the release that was mentioned before by, I think, Lewis, they released, this version.

403
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:12.200
Rafael Matias (skylenet): And,

404
01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:21.730
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Thanks for the shout-out for the logo. Yeah, they released this version, so Benchmarker can directly, consume this, I think it's a zip file.

405
01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:24.460
Rafael Matias (skylenet): And parse the tests, and yeah.

406
01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:29.799
Rafael Matias (skylenet): And it can also do, like, raw JSON false, as I mentioned before.

407
01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:47.750
Rafael Matias (skylenet): And let me actually show you, like… it's very configurable, so yeah, for all… there's a YAML file, of course, that you can, like, configure. One thing you can say, for example, I'm gonna show you this example, and we're going to execute this.

408
01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:58.720
Rafael Matias (skylenet): is, you can say where the test source is from. In this case, we are, like, using this raw JSON approach, because we are doing some stateful tests.

409
01:03:58.970 --> 01:04:12.029
Rafael Matias (skylenet): But in the future, we want to probably have, like, these East fixtures, like, as the standard for everything. And, yeah, it kind of looks like this, like, test source, that you tell it.

410
01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:29.769
Rafael Matias (skylenet): You can also, like, you know, tell… give some specific Genesis files to the clients, resource limits, this is important because there's, like, this EIP, like, for these standard specs for the… for an Ethereum node, so we want to, like, be very close to that.

411
01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:34.629
Rafael Matias (skylenet): So we can do resource limits, also on the CPU clock.

412
01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.360
Rafael Matias (skylenet): And,

413
01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:57.329
Rafael Matias (skylenet): one thing… this thing can run, like, stateless sets, so you don't have, like, any, local state, but an interesting part is also it can also run, stateful tests, or, like, tests against, like, some existing state. And what we have done also is, in this case, you can specify, like, data directories.

414
01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:07.700
Rafael Matias (skylenet): And these are from our snapshots. We downloaded it for PerfdevNet2, and for… I think all of the clients are only… I think it's between one…

415
01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:11.899
Rafael Matias (skylenet): 2… 1.2 and 1.6 terabytes.

416
01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:15.979
Rafael Matias (skylenet): On each client, like, on the data deer size,

417
01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:20.629
Rafael Matias (skylenet): I have them locally, like, for testing purposes, and you basically can define where they are.

418
01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:29.120
Rafael Matias (skylenet): So Benchmarker will pick this up. We support multi… like, CFS, this is, like, a mechanism for file system snapshots.

419
01:05:29.350 --> 01:05:38.190
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Because every time when you run a test, you don't, you know, you don't want to, like, copy the data yet somewhere else, because otherwise this is going to take a lot of time just copying.

420
01:05:38.310 --> 01:05:52.059
Rafael Matias (skylenet): So we do support CFS, Overlay FS, and… yeah, raw copy if you want to do that. And then you have, like, the clients themselves, right? You can… yeah, images, argument, extra arguments, NVARs, whatever.

421
01:05:52.550 --> 01:05:58.800
Rafael Matias (skylenet): You can do all of that, and we are actually gonna run this one, just to see…

422
01:06:00.010 --> 01:06:09.349
Rafael Matias (skylenet): how this works. So I'm saying, yeah, run the config file, and I'm just limiting it to guess, because otherwise this is gonna take…

423
01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:11.280
Rafael Matias (skylenet): A bit longer.

424
01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:27.599
Rafael Matias (skylenet): And this thing is gonna execute, so it's gonna fetch those tests that we referenced there. It runs them against the engine API, and at the end, it will basically create a set of files. It will dump a bunch of files into a results directory.

425
01:06:29.030 --> 01:06:32.640
Rafael Matias (skylenet): And while this is running…

426
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:40.430
Rafael Matias (skylenet): what is gonna happen afterwards… so after we have those results, I think they appear in here.

427
01:06:41.010 --> 01:06:45.930
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Yeah, there. But afterwards, the interesting part is…

428
01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:50.899
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Yeah, you want to see the logo big again, right? No, let me go here.

429
01:06:51.570 --> 01:06:56.619
Rafael Matias (skylenet): So there's also a UI that is able to, like, render the…

430
01:06:56.790 --> 01:07:07.819
Rafael Matias (skylenet): the results afterwards. So we saw the most recent one was, like, a Wrath run. Let me just… let's see if it finished. Oh, there's a new one, right? This one…

431
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.829
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Yeah, it was now, at least based on my clock.

432
01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:16.769
Rafael Matias (skylenet): And let's actually check the console again, just to verify that it finished.

433
01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:30.450
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Yeah, it finished, okay. So if we then, like, click on this, you can see the run details. So you see that it ran 70 tests, you can, like, see little boxes here.

434
01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:37.110
Rafael Matias (skylenet): There's, like, this mega gas limit that… I don't know if we want to go giga gas. This doesn't look good.

435
01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:39.329
Rafael Matias (skylenet): So we have to improve.

436
01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:50.740
Rafael Matias (skylenet): There's also, yeah, more, like, the configuration, which is always important, like, for people, they ask, like, how did you run this, right?

437
01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:59.630
Rafael Matias (skylenet): So it's kind of clear, you see it here. Also very important, when something does not work, you want to see logs, right? So you can, like.

438
01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:07.260
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Press here, and you have… in this case, it's nice because you have the benchmarker logs and the client logs in one.

439
01:08:07.530 --> 01:08:10.090
Rafael Matias (skylenet): So you can see, kind of, what is happening.

440
01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:15.430
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Like, the blue ones are benchmarker, and the purple ones are the client.

441
01:08:18.149 --> 01:08:28.210
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Yeah, and there's, yeah, the generated files that I've mentioned, it generates a bunch of them, but yeah, you don't have to worry about this, the UI kind of knows how to render these.

442
01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:31.760
Rafael Matias (skylenet): This is also interesting.

443
01:08:32.410 --> 01:08:37.130
Rafael Matias (skylenet): like, this graph in here. This is based on something that,

444
01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:47.419
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Carlos did. There's, like, this, there's also a link here, so for this research. It's basically something that blocks slow blocks on the,

445
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:49.439
Rafael Matias (skylenet): execution clients.

446
01:08:49.609 --> 01:09:01.649
Rafael Matias (skylenet): They will basically dump a JSON payload in their logs, and if your client implements this, then Benchmarker can also pick that up and kind of generate disk information.

447
01:09:01.830 --> 01:09:03.899
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Also, like, caching information.

448
01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:08.219
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Yeah, you can see cash-hit ratios and so on.

449
01:09:10.569 --> 01:09:11.639
Rafael Matias (skylenet): What else?

450
01:09:11.899 --> 01:09:19.649
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Yeah, you have a test… you also have additional, like, you see… yeah, all this… this table is also based on that… on that JSON payload that is being logged.

451
01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:24.880
Rafael Matias (skylenet): This currently just works on GEF. I think the other clients have not merged this yet.

452
01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:35.389
Rafael Matias (skylenet): You have resource information over time, and also important, like, if, let's say, let's scroll up, right? You are like, oh, why, I don't know.

453
01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:41.819
Rafael Matias (skylenet): let's maybe scroll this… why is this one orange, right? Why is this slow? So you can click it.

454
01:09:42.319 --> 01:09:50.390
Rafael Matias (skylenet): You have, yeah, some more metrics. You can also see the raw requests that were done and responses.

455
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:55.059
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Yeah, so there's, like, a lot of information to debug.

456
01:09:55.270 --> 01:10:01.810
Rafael Matias (skylenet): set… there's, like, test steps and setup steps. Setups are done before the test, it's just, yeah, sometimes you have…

457
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:04.509
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Some calls you have to do before the test.

458
01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:12.859
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Yeah, and… There's, yeah, there's also this definition of sweet.

459
01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:30.720
Rafael Matias (skylenet): So you see that this test belongs to this suite. It's… a suite is just basically a set of the same tests, so that, you know, you can actually compare them between clients, like, how something looks like. This is basically, you can see more information about what it's doing, or where the test came from.

460
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:32.680
Rafael Matias (skylenet): And it's… yeah.

461
01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:38.219
Rafael Matias (skylenet): It's just doing some stateful tests, and I'm just doing Xen. Yikes, just Xen.

462
01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:41.650
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Yeah, this one.

463
01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:54.450
Rafael Matias (skylenet): And I think that's more or less… yeah, I think when you go… yeah, this is also interesting, like, when you go to the suite page, you see the test heatmap, so you see the slowest tests across, like, all clients,

464
01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:58.359
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Yeah, and then you can, like, go dig in deeper if you wanna.

465
01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:03.929
Rafael Matias (skylenet): And, yeah, at the bottom, you see every run for that suite.

466
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:05.979
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Then you can, like, breath.

467
01:11:06.690 --> 01:11:12.190
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Yeah, and REST doesn't have, like, those other graphs because they don't implement the JSON log yet.

468
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:20.340
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Yeah, I think that's more or less it, just like a… Quick glance on this front.

469
01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:24.219
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Yeah, if there are any questions, feel free to ask.

470
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:27.529
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Or message me, like, on Discord.

471
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:45.840
Mario Vega: Thank you so much, Rafael. I think we only have one question in the chat, and it is, are you getting the results on all the runs, or there is a way to have the runs for warm-up, and then use other runs for getting the metrics? This comes from Amazon.

472
01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:55.330
Rafael Matias (skylenet): if I'm getting the… so, I'm not sure if I understood your question correctly,

473
01:11:55.820 --> 01:12:05.349
Rafael Matias (skylenet): But is this more, like, about optimizing the runtime? Like, doing, like, warm-up, if there are warm-up phases to them, and then, like, you know, snapshot and do, like, the test phase?

474
01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:09.310
Ameziane Hamlat: Yeah, so… so this is more related to Baesu.

475
01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:28.539
Ameziane Hamlat: Maybe, at some point with another mind. So when you restart base, so if you try to benchmark directly, you are getting wrong results, because Java needs some warm-up, needs to execute some methods at some level, so there are some thresholds, and when we hit those thresholds.

476
01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:31.830
Ameziane Hamlat: Those methods are, are compiled to,

477
01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:44.300
Ameziane Hamlat: to assembly, basically, but before they are interpreted. So we need to, to basically have that, that warm-up that is already done.

478
01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:49.359
Ameziane Hamlat: to… to get… to get the results. So, Netherland benchmarks.

479
01:12:50.100 --> 01:13:03.569
Ameziane Hamlat: does that, actually, at some point. So I wanted to know if that was replicated in those benchmarks. But by the way, great work, great rate, really impressive.

480
01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:11.419
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Thank you. Yes, and regarding that warm-up thingy, so I also have seen that on the gas benchmarks, and yes, we can also do that,

481
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:18.549
Rafael Matias (skylenet): So it's basically, if I remember correctly, it's just executing a test, but generating, like, a wrong,

482
01:13:18.970 --> 01:13:22.870
Rafael Matias (skylenet): State root hash or something on the new payload so that it kind of warms up.

483
01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:26.300
Rafael Matias (skylenet): And yes, we can do that.

484
01:13:26.710 --> 01:13:28.069
Rafael Matias (skylenet): It's already supported.

485
01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:30.870
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Camille, you can correct me if I said something.

486
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:45.770
Kamil Chodoła: Yeah, exactly, just wanted to confirm, and as you've seen, for now, this is utilizing still the benchmarks which are either generated by ELs, or by gas benchmarks for stateful operations, or stateful tests in general.

487
01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:53.069
Kamil Chodoła: So, yeah, so warm-ups are still… are there, and I'm not sure, probably, it is either not yet enabled, or…

488
01:13:53.070 --> 01:14:01.010
Kamil Chodoła: there is just a small bit which needs to be added, and the benchmark should be, like, feature complete with gas benchmarks, and…

489
01:14:01.150 --> 01:14:08.550
Kamil Chodoła: extra things on top of that. So, like, this is, like, an evolution of gas benchmarks, so all the features which were before should be there.

490
01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:12.670
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Yes.

491
01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:19.650
Ameziane Hamlat: Okay, so how about, how about stateful tests? So, when we have a snapshot.

492
01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:28.880
Ameziane Hamlat: Then we, we start a node, and, on top of that snapshot, and we generate those new blocks.

493
01:14:29.150 --> 01:14:32.459
Ameziane Hamlat: How does the warm-up work in this case?

494
01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.300
Ameziane Hamlat: Work in this case.

495
01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:40.959
Kamil Chodoła: So, warm-up will be still exactly the same, so,

496
01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:49.630
Kamil Chodoła: we are generating the tests on top of state, also with the usage of overlay or ZTFS, and we are generating also the…

497
01:14:49.940 --> 01:15:05.590
Kamil Chodoła: warm-ups in the exact same way. So we are stoning up the overlay on top of the database, creating bunch of, executing a bunch of tests with mismatch of state root, and saving the… saving everything into the file, so it is also still…

498
01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:10.030
Kamil Chodoła: Capable to execute in the exact same way as we did on stateless tests.

499
01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:16.830
Kamil Chodoła: So, differences… There is no difference except that those are generated on top of state.

500
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:19.600
Ameziane Hamlat: Okay, thanks.

501
01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:28.599
Mario Vega: Right. Thank you, thank you, Rafael. Are there any more questions, regarding this?

502
01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:43.289
Mario Vega: If not, thanks again, Rafael, for the amazing presentation. I think that's it for today. Thanks, everyone, for joining. Sorry for going over time. Alright, see you in the next call.

503
01:15:43.730 --> 01:15:44.680
Mario Vega: Thank you.

504
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:45.600
Kamil Chodoła: Okay, bye.

505
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.820
Rafael Matias (skylenet): Aye!

506
01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:47.500
Louis: Bye.
