That’s the one we use with Besu
00:19:43	Potuz:	Just in case, but a lot of these would have to change when we rebase either 7732 on top of this or BAL on top of 7732

This issue is out of date now. Will update after the call.

00:29:53	Francesco:	Unless someone else wants to take up pushing forward that PR, I don’t have time to do so immediately, so would be happy if we can just postpone this
00:30:08	Justin Traglia:	Replying to "Unless someone else ..."

Will postpone.
00:30:21	Potuz:	Replying to "Unless someone else ..."

I can take care of it Francesco If you let me
00:30:39	Potuz:	Replying to "Unless someone else ..."

I can add what I think should be the wording for it so that it deals with DA as well
00:30:51	Francesco:	Replying to "Unless someone else ..."

Will reply on telegram after the call 😄 But yeah, go ahead
00:31:24	Potuz:	Replying to "Unless someone else ..."

BTW, I opened one for DA already and we’re waiting for your review 🙂
00:32:14	Potuz:	Did that merge Justin?
