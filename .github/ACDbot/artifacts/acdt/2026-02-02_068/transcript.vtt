00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.710
Barnabas: No.

2
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.660
Pooja Ranjan: Hello, hello.

3
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.540
Justin Traglia: Good morning.

4
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.210
Manu: Good morning.

5
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.090
Justin Traglia: Good morning, POTUS. I wasn't sure if you were gonna be here.

6
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.190
Potuz: I'm just in the middle of nowhere. I'm not sure if this is going to last, but for now it's working.

7
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.869
Justin Traglia: Okay, and I can hear you just fine, by the way.

8
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.340
Justin Traglia: For the middle of nowhere.

9
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.419
Barnabas: I can hear you better than usually.

10
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.159
Justin Traglia: Yeah, no joke.

11
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.920
Barnabas: You probably have better internet there in the middle of nowhere than in the office.

12
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.490
Justin Traglia: Yeah.

13
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.700
Justin Traglia: But nice, yeah, it does look like the middle of nowhere.

14
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.469
Justin Traglia: Middle of a jungle.

15
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.079
Barnabas: I'll just give it another minute, and then we can get started.

16
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:14.029
Barnabas: Welcome, everybody, to Oko Dev's testing call. Pooja, can you… Get the streamer started?

17
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.389
Pooja Ranjan: We are live.

18
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:25.719
Barnabas: Thank you. Welcome, everybody, to Opera Dev's listening call, ACD number 68. It's the 2nd of February.

19
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:33.079
Barnabas: And, let's get right into it. So, the agenda is quite busy for today.

20
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.799
Barnabas: First of all, let's get into Fusaka.

21
00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:40.739
Barnabas: We have been working on the partial cell proofs in the past couple of weeks.

22
00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:46.910
Barnabas: We have launched the Blob.net Zero, and currently our supernodes are struggling to

23
00:08:47.000 --> 00:09:06.420
Barnabas: keep up with the, blob demand, because, they've adjusted the minimum epochs for data column sidecar requests to 256, so that means that the number of blobs that we should store is, up till, only one day, but instead, Prism and Lighthouse

24
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:12.279
Barnabas: Do not seem to be respecting this flag, so, we're gonna need to…

25
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:24.799
Barnabas: either do something to make sure that they will respect it, or look the databases, or adjust the number of blobs we send through. Otherwise, this… that note is going to get very expensive very fast.

26
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:30.100
Barnabas: We can probably discuss the async, but,

27
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.989
Barnabas: It's just something that I wanted to raise today.

28
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.420
Barnabas: Does anyone have anything to say regarding Blob.netzero?

29
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:49.999
Barnabas: Daniel, commented that he's gonna take a look into this, and hopefully someone from present can also take a look.

30
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:57.860
Barnabas: And we are, looking for other CLTs to also,

31
00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:05.579
Barnabas: Begin implementing the partial cells, or finish implementing the partial cells, so that we can add them to this template.

32
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.230
Barnabas: Thank you, Venice.

33
00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:14.970
Barnabas: Okay, next topic is gas limit testing.

34
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:21.240
Barnabas: Would anybody have any updates regarding, current, benchmarking?

35
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:39.740
Barnabas: Mmm, maybe… This one? Or… I don't want to put anyone on the spot.

36
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.780
Barnabas: I'm not sure if we even have any updates.

37
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.939
Barnabas: In case we don't know,

38
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:59.630
Barnabas: I will propose that, we will, have, Rafael from our team, come online next week,

39
00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:16.029
Barnabas: to showcase benchmarking tool, benchmarker, that is going to help, the ELs basically benchmark their EL performance. Hopefully he can give us a short, 5-10 minute live demo, and, show us how it works.

40
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:24.960
Barnabas: If there's nothing else regarding estimate testing this week, then we can quickly move on to the next topic already.

41
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:28.580
Barnabas: Which would be Glamsterdam?

42
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:35.840
Barnabas: Regarding, ball W2, stefan, could you give us an update?

43
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.180
Stefan Starflinger: Yeah, sure.

44
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:48.089
Stefan Starflinger: So, I've been testing, over the weekend, all of the different clients. I will share the spec, in the chat.

45
00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:52.949
Stefan Starflinger: And I try to keep it up to date. It might not be 100% accurate everywhere.

46
00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.279
Stefan Starflinger: And, I shared, some issues also.

47
00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:04.760
Stefan Starflinger: In the, ethereum… I'll share it here also.

48
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:15.850
Stefan Starflinger: So in general, most clients are pretty far. There has been a test release, 5.1.0, maybe not all clients are aware of that yet.

49
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:32.959
Stefan Starflinger: there are still a few clients that need to remove the gas parameter from the receipt, so Bezo and Nethermind still need to remove it. This is from the first, so if you push anything today, then it might not be 100% up-to-date.

50
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:47.879
Stefan Starflinger: There's also some other issue, I think, that's already been fixed in NetherMind, with the get payload. Then Nimbus, I identified the issue that still needs to be fixed, where, the activation

51
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:54.269
Stefan Starflinger: of some gloss features is already happening too early, in Fulu instead of in gloss.

52
00:12:54.400 --> 00:13:06.969
Stefan Starflinger: It's described here as well, and then Geth is already working on some issues here. And I also fixed some small issue in Lighthouse, so we have both Lighthouse

53
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:22.440
Stefan Starflinger: and Lodestar SCL ready for testing. In the spec sheet, I have a small example for a Krutosis config, and if your client is working really well, you should also try to add the EVM fuzz.

54
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:31.540
Stefan Starflinger: to the network and see if it, can, work under some transaction load as well. So,

55
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:51.420
Stefan Starflinger: PK has already modified the latest spammer to… and the EVM first scenario to include the new opcodes. So, slot num op codes and the other call stack opcodes as well. So that would be great if you have some time to test with the spammer as well.

56
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:56.530
Stefan Starflinger: I think that's pretty much it, and the network will launch on Wednesday.

57
00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:00.960
Stefan Starflinger: And I think, we should be able to get everything ready by then.

58
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:08.909
Stefan Starflinger: It would also be good to get an update from clients, as well, but I'll hand it back to Barnabas.

59
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:17.589
Barnabas: Yeah, so just before the client updates, maybe we can still discuss the two open,

60
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:22.250
Barnabas: PRs that are 726 that I just linked.

61
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:30.640
Barnabas: This is an execution API PR that adds, let's use an RPC method.

62
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:34.700
Barnabas: Maybe, can you get an update on this?

63
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:43.470
Stefan Starflinger: These are not a blocker. It would be nice to include them in DevNet2, but we don't need to have them ready for the launch.

64
00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:49.410
Barnabas: I, yeah, I understand, I'm just curious if there's any blockers in merging these in.

65
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.330
Stefan Starflinger: I'm not aware of any.

66
00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:08.499
Stefan Starflinger: But we can ask Tony if there's any update on that. I'm not sure if he's on the call.

67
00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:13.090
Barnabas: can see Tony on the call, so maybe we can check with him.

68
00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:18.150
Barnabas: No, I'm on the call. What was the concrete question?

69
00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:24.739
Barnabas: Whether we could, get 726 and 727, merged in.

70
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.799
Toni Wahrstätter: Okay, yeah, I will have a look, and let's… Figure that out. Async.

71
00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:41.600
Barnabas: Yep, sounds good. Let's, target the mergers in… by Wednesday as well, if you can.

72
00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.210
Barnabas: Okay, so can we do a.

73
00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:59.530
Toni Wahrstätter: Alright, one of them is the JSON RPC. Would be great if clients can give input if they have implemented that already. I tested your, Cortosis config, Stefan, and it seemed like

74
00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:02.850
Toni Wahrstätter: at least for GEF, the JSON RPC didn't work yet.

75
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:04.499
Toni Wahrstätter: So it'll be…

76
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.019
Stefan Starflinger: I don't think it's implemented by any client yet.

77
00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.419
Toni Wahrstätter: But I think it's.

78
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:20.289
Stefan Starflinger: shouldn't the spec be merged first before? Or generally, I don't know exactly what the best process is here, but generally, I would assume that first the spec should be merged, and then clients implement.

79
00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:22.490
Stefan Starflinger: For it.

80
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:28.469
Toni Wahrstätter: Right, yeah, it would be great in this case, if we get this back, if we get the PRs merged.

81
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.170
Barnabas: Yep.

82
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:41.390
Toni Wahrstätter: One of them is engine API related, and the other one is the JSON RPC methods, and both of them are approved, and, yeah, I don't see any reason why we shouldn't merge them now.

83
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.150
Barnabas: Yes, Jared, that's what you're talking about.

84
00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:12.979
Barnabas: Would any clients have an update, whether they have taken a look into implementing these two, PRs, and whether there are any blockers?

85
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.500
Barnabas: Maybe you can go in order. Anyone from Bism?

86
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:51.599
Karim T. (matkt): So, Zoom, we are close to be ready. The NGEM API, we merged the two engine APIs. We still have some open PR, so…

87
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:58.349
Karim T. (matkt): We have an open PR for metrics, we want to add some metrics for block access.

88
00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:05.830
Karim T. (matkt): We have also the prefetch, it's open, but I think we'll try to merge everything

89
00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:11.050
Karim T. (matkt): Today or tomorrow, and it'll be okay. So…

90
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:18.239
Karim T. (matkt): just, some PR2 merge. We are passing some… the test we tried with the last version.

91
00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:26.019
Karim T. (matkt): And we also did some tests with the local testnet, so… yeah, for now, it seems that we are okay.

92
00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:32.099
Barnabas: Thank you. Anyone from Nethermind?

93
00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:46.590
Marc: Sorry, yeah, so was this the, engine API method to get the valves directly? Because I…

94
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.579
Marc: I thought that that was changed, so it was just included in the payload.

95
00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:12.429
Stefan Starflinger: I mean, there's a… there's a payload, there's an engine API payload part, or the GET payload, and we have the engine fork choice update version 4.

96
00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:18.049
Stefan Starflinger: But the methods we're, describing here, I think these are…

97
00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:24.949
Stefan Starflinger: The, engine get payload bodies by hash, and, get payload bodies by range.

98
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:31.299
Marc: Yeah, yeah, so, I implemented get block access list by hash.

99
00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:35.620
Marc: But I haven't yet made the change to move it to the payload.

100
00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.600
Barnabas: Right. Anyone from GEF?

101
00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:59.619
Jared Wasinger: Yeah, we're… well, I am still fixing bugs.

102
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:11.819
Jared Wasinger: Broken blockchain tests, I still need to implement the, the Edge and API method, but,

103
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:17.639
Jared Wasinger: Yeah, planning on trying to knock that out and get us ready in the next few days.

104
00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:22.959
Barnabas: Okay, thank you. From Russ?

105
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:35.369
Jen: Let me take a look and give you a proper update. We have some PRs in progress. Can you clarify when you need these by? Are they… are they important for DEFNET2?

106
00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:43.569
Barnabas: Ideally, the PR should be merged in, either today or tomorrow, and then we should target these four that include, yes?

107
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:44.740
Jen: Okay.

108
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:47.540
Jen: So by Wednesday, you should be able to do that.

109
00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:49.340
Barnabas: Thank you.

110
00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.080
Barnabas: Ergon?

111
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:04.020
Barnabas: I guess somebody from Eragon around,

112
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:11.219
Barnabas: Okay, is there any other block-level access list topics that we need to discuss?

113
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:24.660
Barnabas: everybody, should be aware of all the bugs that are present in their clients right now, and we should be able to target the DevNet launch by Wednesday.

114
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:33.419
Stefan Starflinger: Yeah, it would be good if we could get also the bowel tests numbers up. That would be great, and if there's any blocker to let us know.

115
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:51.740
Barnabas: Caleb, is that Nimbus DL?

116
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.729
Barnabas: Or block number access list?

117
00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.810
Caleb: Yes, it's Ace.

118
00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:00.680
Caleb: So, basically, the invoice is pretty much ready to go.

119
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.529
Caleb: I don't know, one thing to notice that…

120
00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:09.609
Caleb: So we… we treat Glaus as the relevant folk, instead of the…

121
00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:16.730
Caleb: the AIP featured him in the bow, so basically… That's it.

122
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.859
Barnabas: Right, but this is on the CR side, right?

123
00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.649
Caleb: Yeah, yeah, on the sales side, yeah.

124
00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.500
Barnabas: Okay.

125
00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.300
Barnabas: Yeah, we can give this a test as well. Stefan, if you…

126
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:34.530
Barnabas: So the bandwidth to add, bandwidth also into the testing scope?

127
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.179
Stefan Starflinger: Sounds great. I will have a look.

128
00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:39.910
Barnabas: Okay, thank you.

129
00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:44.779
Barnabas: Next topic is APBS.

130
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:48.800
Barnabas: it'd be good if we could get a…

131
00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:55.070
Barnabas: Update from the different client teams regarding their, Implementation?

132
00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.220
Barnabas: progressed?

133
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:08.119
Stefan Bratanov: I can give an update from Teco.

134
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:20.440
Stefan Bratanov: Basically, implementing, now, the… New specs, which will be released, hopefully, today or tomorrow.

135
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:30.039
Stefan Bratanov: Yeah, that's… that's pretty much it, and then we'll focus on the… on the rest for DevNet Zero. We still have quite a bit…

136
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:32.829
Barnabas: We do…

137
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:36.850
Justin Traglia: need to decide if this is what we want to do. Like, I need some confirmation.

138
00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:39.120
Stefan Bratanov: Oh, okay.

139
00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:40.680
Justin Traglia: Yep.

140
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.259
Justin Traglia: I guess this ties into the…

141
00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:56.500
Barnabas: Alright, moving. Before we go into that, is there any reason that you guys are looking into implementing the next spec that hasn't even been released, instead of focusing on the scope of zero?

142
00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:03.089
Justin Traglia: It's because we're talking about, changing the scope of DevNet Zero.

143
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:12.100
Justin Traglia: Like, clients want the… The change, which includes moving the, block KZG commitments

144
00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:15.120
Justin Traglia: To the, to the bid.

145
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:22.180
Barnabas: Okay, so the idea is to basically have the Alpha 2 as the scope for 00.

146
00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.999
Justin Traglia: Yes, that's correct.

147
00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:33.320
Justin Traglia: I could, I mean, if we agreed to this, I can make the release, like, right now, and it would be ready, this time tomorrow.

148
00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:41.289
Potuz: There's no program inside of Prism, either way works for us.

149
00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:51.530
Eitan: White House.

150
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:52.479
Barnabas: from an iPhone? Yep.

151
00:24:52.480 --> 00:25:04.489
Eitan: Yeah, Lighthouse prefers that we do the blob KCG commitment stuff for DevNet Zero. But yeah, we were making steady progress towards, like, an end of February DevNet.

152
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:13.780
Eitan: And, yeah, we have those, data column sidecar changes, like, moving the KZG commitments to the payload bid ready,

153
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:18.610
Eitan: And, like, made a lot of,

154
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:24.399
Eitan: changes that are ready to be merged around the new spec. We're also passing spec

155
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:28.410
Eitan: tests for Alpha-1, yeah.

156
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:35.279
Barnabas: Are there any other changes that,

157
00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:42.370
Barnabas: could basically slow us down. I know that everybody wants to basically have this…

158
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:52.800
Potuz: These changes do not slow us down, though. These changes actually would make it faster for us, because it simplifies a lot on the implementation side.

159
00:25:53.050 --> 00:26:01.199
Potuz: And all of the remaining changes on the spec, as far as I know, they are not hard work, so we can just start merging them as soon as we want.

160
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:06.769
Potuz: And we can… we can or may not deploy them on the definite, that's fine.

161
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:14.950
Barnabas: Okay, so anyone from NoteStar could also chime in?

162
00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.240
NC: Yeah, we're in favor of doing it.

163
00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:24.400
Barnabas: Nimbus?

164
00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:44.640
Caleb: Hi. I'm sorry, are we talking about, PBS.netzero?

165
00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:51.820
Barnabas: Yes, we were talking about the scope of EPBS.0, and whether or not we should be targeting alpha

166
00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:59.139
Barnabas: 1.7.0 alpha 2, or Alpha 1 as the target, consistent spec release.

167
00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:04.429
Caleb: So I think we should be targeting the…

168
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:10.030
Caleb: There are offers at 1.7.2, because,

169
00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:23.029
Caleb: We've pretty much implemented all the changes from the previous release, and I don't see us spending so much time in implementing anything new, actually, so I feel like we are good to go anyways.

170
00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:26.849
Barnabas: Okay, so in favor to do the new respect.

171
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:28.490
Caleb: Yes, yes, we know, yeah.

172
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:30.850
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: Mmm.

173
00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:32.559
Barnabas: Anybody from Grandin?

174
00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:37.239
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: Yeah, so I think that the later spec,

175
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:50.010
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: it's better, because, I mean, we are a bit far from, I mean, like, a month or so until the DevNet, and it makes sense to implement now the

176
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:55.280
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: the newer spec. So yeah, we support the latest spec.

177
00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.070
Barnabas: Alright.

178
00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:05.099
Barnabas: One more question, regarding the Alpha 2 is the variable PTC deadline.

179
00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:11.040
Barnabas: Justin, was that the one that, was… outdated?

180
00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:18.890
Justin Traglia: I don't… I don't plan on including that change in this release. We can save that for the next release.

181
00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:22.110
Barnabas: Right, okay.

182
00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:26.160
Potuz: I'm sorry, we change?

183
00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:30.859
Justin Traglia: Francesco's variable BTC Deadline PR.

184
00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:41.680
Potuz: Just… just in case this is not clear, when people say, like, we're targeting this or that spec.

185
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:50.000
Potuz: That's not really what's gonna happen on the DevNet. The DevNet is going to have the structure of those specs, but not the feature of those specs.

186
00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:54.259
Potuz: So, we're going to target a strict subset of the spec.

187
00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:00.240
Justin Traglia: Indeed.

188
00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:19.239
Potuz: So, those changes, you can or cannot merge them, because it's fine. I mean, the PR… Francesco's PR, as it is now, it's not mergeable, but whenever we merge it, it's fine if we do it or not, because it will not affect any DevNet.

189
00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:28.340
Barnabas: Also?

190
00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:34.179
Potuz: for choice is kind of irrelevant for DevNets. We're not testing for choice.

191
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:40.709
Barnabas: But wouldn't the variable PTC deadline be,

192
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:48.400
Potuz: We are not going to even send PTC attestation, so it's fine. It doesn't matter. We're gonna build on top of the full block.

193
00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:58.870
Potuz: Like, dealing with the subtleties of timings and when we're gonna reorg and these kind of things, this is going to become much, much later in the testing scenario.

194
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:07.919
Barnabas: Right, okay, let's, push the variable PTC deadline, PR then out of the scope of Alpha 2.

195
00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.219
Barnabas: And, target that for a later release.

196
00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:12.440
Barnabas: Trustin?

197
00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:17.989
Justin Traglia: Yep, that sounds good to me. I will make a release after… after the call.

198
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.690
Barnabas: Sounds good.

199
00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:25.300
Barnabas: And then, regarding, implementation readiness.

200
00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:30.410
Barnabas: Can we still aim to launch around the 18th of February?

201
00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:33.519
Barnabas: Is it, does it sound reasonable?

202
00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:36.820
Barnabas: And with the new specs, and that would be Alpha 2 released then?

203
00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:23.459
Barnabas: I guess, nobody's quite sure yet whether implementations would be ready by then, so maybe we can push that question to next week as well.

204
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:34.710
Barnabas: Is there any other updates, regarding… Epbs topic?

205
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:40.400
Justin Traglia: Nothing from my side.

206
00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:53.979
Justin Traglia: Or actually, wait, we did close the, remove min builder withdrawabilityDelay and, replace it with the one that lowered the value. I think we chose 64 epochs.

207
00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.720
Justin Traglia: Or… Something like that, yeah, I think 64.

208
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:04.829
Barnabas: Okay, then that will also be part of the Alpha 2?

209
00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:11.010
Justin Traglia: Yes, I will. But it'll be such a… such a simple change, just changing it.

210
00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.889
Justin Traglia: Constant, or config.

211
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.959
Justin Traglia: Yes, that did merge protos. I just shared the PR.

212
00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.000
Barnabas: Thank you.

213
00:32:52.090 --> 00:33:01.760
Barnabas: Okay, if there's no more Glamsterdam topics, then we can move on to Hagota, as there's not that much happening in Hagota yet.

214
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:16.630
Barnabas: Just one point to note is that the headliner proposal deadline is approaching. There's only two more days left, so if you have a Haguta proposal, headliner proposal, then make sure to submit it in the next two days.

215
00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:24.640
Barnabas: And it looks like, actually went through… Oh.

216
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:28.790
Barnabas: Portos… Had a comment as well?

217
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.760
Barnabas: But I think we discussed that already.

218
00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:35.310
Barnabas: And we discussed all the ball topics as well, so…

219
00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:38.400
Barnabas: Does anybody else has anything else to add?

220
00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:51.949
Barnabas: It's not, that's it for today, and let's get back to work.

221
00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.999
Barnabas: Thanks for coming.

222
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:56.640
Potuz: Nice. Bye.

223
00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:57.530
Potuz: See you guys.

224
00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.090
Justin Traglia: Bye, everyone.

225
00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:00.130
Marius van der Wijden: But…
