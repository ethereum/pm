00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:54.590
Chase Wright: Hey, everyone. I'm gonna ping Boma, see if they're joining or not. They usually host, so…

2
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:18.400
Chase Wright: I guess we can just get started, the harder, let me see here…

3
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.670
Chase Wright: Let's see…

4
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:33.730
Chase Wright: So, I guess before we get started, does anyone have anything they want to bring up in addition to the agenda that…

5
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.390
Chase Wright: Bomer wrote down.

6
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:52.469
Chase Wright: I'll take that as a no. The first one is about versioning information. I know that there's…

7
00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.670
Chase Wright: some asks for us to, start doing version releases.

8
00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.960
Chase Wright: I think we can probably start doing that relatively soon. There's a lot of…

9
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:14.819
Chase Wright: outdated and open PRs, though, that it would be really nice to get cleaned up and figure out what the

10
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.320
Chase Wright: first version release should look like.

11
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.839
Chase Wright: Does anyone have any thoughts on that?

12
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.929
Chase Wright: Okay, I guess not.

13
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:45.000
Chase Wright: I went through some of these. I think most of these PRs Either… Need to get, closed?

14
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:53.650
Chase Wright: Or… The maintain… like, the person who submitted them need to come in and resolve some of their conflicts?

15
00:06:53.900 --> 00:07:00.819
Chase Wright: I don't… All the stale ones from, like, 23?

16
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.889
Chase Wright: They seem to just… not be… no one seems to care anymore.

17
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.160
Chase Wright: I don't really have any insight into any of these.

18
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.950
Chase Wright: Like, this one is still interesting, I think.

19
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.130
Chase Wright: Yeah, I don't know, this one might cause… some issues.

20
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.889
Chase Wright: Does anyone have any opinions at all?

21
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.550
Tullio | Erigon: Oh, yeah.

22
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:53.020
Tullio | Erigon: Good afternoon, I'm Tulio, and yeah, I think, It depends on what… We want to do… towards…

23
00:07:53.140 --> 00:08:05.840
Tullio | Erigon: The… the client of this… API. I mean, strictly speaking, we should still support such kind of…

24
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.960
Tullio | Erigon: methods, at least for… pre-marriage blocks.

25
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:18.059
Tullio | Erigon: But then, yeah, it's… probably no one cares, really cares.

26
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.100
Tullio | Erigon: So yeah, it's a bit,

27
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:27.079
Tullio | Erigon: I have an… have an issue between being, strict in terms of

28
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:34.150
Tullio | Erigon: At the interface level, or being… Let's see… Practical, yeah?

29
00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:41.169
Chase Wright: Yeah, actually, and you know, that's a good point, because you know.

30
00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:45.309
Chase Wright: the RETH team brought up this PR.

31
00:08:45.549 --> 00:08:51.729
Chase Wright: And, I think the ETHREX guys have the same problem, and…

32
00:08:52.209 --> 00:08:57.869
Chase Wright: Correct me if I'm wrong, I think you guys on the Aragon side, you… you… you fixed this just recently.

33
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.479
Tullio | Erigon: Yes, yes, we did, we did recently.

34
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:06.449
Chase Wright: Yeah. So, yeah, it's kind of a double-edged sword, because, like.

35
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:11.309
Chase Wright: As you said, those methods are valid for, like, pre-merge

36
00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.390
Chase Wright: Data, but, like…

37
00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:30.659
Chase Wright: Does anyone actually care? I think that is… that is one of the main questions, because I know that… I think it's… in protocol, like, the nodes don't even need to save the uncle blocks, so, like, having the methods…

38
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.580
Chase Wright: That are non-deterministic.

39
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.390
Chase Wright: Anyway, seems counterproductive.

40
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.570
Chase Wright: Because, like, we can't really write tests for them.

41
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:47.820
Chase Wright: And the nodes aren't required to keep the uncles anyway.

42
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:48.740
Chase Wright: So…

43
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:49.460
Tullio | Erigon: Yeah.

44
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:50.970
Chase Wright: Fair enough.

45
00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.660
Chase Wright: I don't know, it might make sense…

46
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.750
Tullio | Erigon: Yeah, it's probably just a technical debit, and that's it.

47
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.509
Chase Wright: Yeah, yeah, I agree with that. I don't really…

48
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.879
Chase Wright: I don't really have a strong opinion on it.

49
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:17.730
Chase Wright: This… this PR seems good. I don't know, it's just a wrapper to the main… so it's async.

50
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:23.359
Chase Wright: I don't have any problems with this particular PR.

51
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.950
Chase Wright: It seems fine, it doesn't really do anything.

52
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:34.299
Chase Wright: Unfortunately, I'm not… I'm not an approver, though, so I can't do anything about it.

53
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:41.950
Chase Wright: The other ones are all, like I said, these are all incredibly old. They need… fixes…

54
00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.650
Chase Wright: I don't think we're gonna make a decision on any of these…

55
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:56.180
Chase Wright: anytime soon. Standardization of the TX pool is… is a good one. This probably needs…

56
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.320
Chase Wright: Need some eyes, you probably need to…

57
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:07.130
Chase Wright: work on this at some point. I think adding tests… to this… Fo…

58
00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:12.120
Chase Wright: Fixing the standard and putting tests, probably a good…

59
00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:18.219
Chase Wright: next step for this PR, but it has conflicts,

60
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.920
Chase Wright: And I think we need to… finalize…

61
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:34.940
Chase Wright: what version 1's gonna look like, which I know Bowman was working on, but I… she's… she's not here, so… maybe we'll have to push that conversation out till the next meeting.

62
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:45.290
Chase Wright: Yeah, and that's pretty much all I got. I know that, I do have…

63
00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:54.829
Chase Wright: I have this PR, which is in draft. This is an ask from the Pandas. They want a, testing

64
00:11:55.110 --> 00:12:05.999
Chase Wright: Build BlockV1 RPC method. Marius did a bunch of work on Geth to support this method. The…

65
00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:14.509
Chase Wright: The standard is defined in this PR, and there's lots of conversation here. I'll post this in the,

66
00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:23.729
Chase Wright: In the chat, if I can find it. Okay, here's the chat, so I'm gonna post this. So, if anyone has any input on this particular…

67
00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:30.459
Chase Wright: RPC method, please… Please provide some feedback.

68
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:39.100
Chase Wright: I've started putting the spec into YAML format in this PR, which I can paste here.

69
00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:47.340
Chase Wright: And… Everything is working, in the Go Ethereum fork, that this…

70
00:12:48.010 --> 00:13:00.670
Chase Wright: PR is referencing. Unfortunately, I still need to get Marius to review the PR, and we can get this merged into Geth, and then once that's there, then,

71
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:07.110
Chase Wright: Geth will have support for this particular method. I don't know… Aragon…

72
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:11.340
Chase Wright: can support something similar, that would be great.

73
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.170
Tullio | Erigon: I need to take a look, but…

74
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:17.540
Tullio | Erigon: Yeah, I think… I think so, but I will take a closer look.

75
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:24.989
Chase Wright: Yeah, apparently this is supposed to make it much easier for the pandas to… to test,

76
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:30.560
Chase Wright: Different, like, forks and building special blocks and stuff.

77
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:35.729
Chase Wright: So, yeah, if you could take a look, that'd be great.

78
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.589
Chase Wright: Yeah, that's pretty much it, unless anyone has anything else they want to talk about.

79
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.150
Chase Wright: Oh, there's also the,

80
00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.450
Chase Wright: What was it? The,

81
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:24.930
Chase Wright: Whenever… this… I think this is fine, but we need a maintainer to rerun it, so…

82
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:42.420
Chase Wright: Yep. Alright, that's it. I don't have anything more, and it doesn't sound like you guys have much else either.

83
00:14:52.100 --> 00:15:00.899
Chase Wright: Cool. Tulio, I know you sent me a message in Discord, so, we can chat,

84
00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:01.960
Chase Wright: Thank you.

85
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.000
Chanderprakash: Oh, hi.

86
00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.750
Chase Wright: Yeah, bye.

87
00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:06.740
Chanderprakash: Now, historic…

88
00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.669
Chase Wright: Sorry, you're muted again.

89
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.450
Chanderprakash: Hi, sorry, sorry for interrupting you.

90
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.819
Chase Wright: No, it's okay, what's up?

91
00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:31.569
Chanderprakash: Yeah, so yeah, you guys are discussing about RPC endpoints, PRs, so I'm, like, not new to the Ethereum, I am working in Ethereum research on Layer 2 stack.

92
00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:43.999
Chanderprakash: But, right now, I want to participate, too, in, co-development. So, could you, please guide, like, how I can help you guys to further push the Ethereum forward?

93
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.079
Chanderprakash: Where I can contribute meaningfully.

94
00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:57.140
Chase Wright: Yeah, I mean… I think… I think…

95
00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:03.760
Chase Wright: So, some of the… some of the struggle right now we're having is… is… the…

96
00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:09.409
Chase Wright: Maintainers, are very, very busy.

97
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:21.260
Chase Wright: if we could get more… more eyes on some of these PRs for comments, either… Closing, or…

98
00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:26.610
Chase Wright: Reviews, comments, feedbacks, anything we could get.

99
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:31.450
Chase Wright: on these, there are… Some,

100
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:39.919
Chase Wright: there are some, like, wish lists. I know one of the things that we want to do is we want to start writing tests for the debug namespace.

101
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:57.200
Chase Wright: Because there's only a handful of them for, like, debug, get, raw, whatever. We want to try to start standardizing on, like, tracing and things like that. So if you have any insight into,

102
00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:04.210
Chase Wright: like the opcode tracer, or call tracer, things like that. We really want to get some of that standardized.

103
00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:14.520
Chase Wright: Another thing that was recently brought up is the, The debug set head.

104
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:27.409
Chase Wright: method. It's not currently standardized across the clients. So, like, Netherland has a different name for it. I don't think Aragon supports it.

105
00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:36.430
Chase Wright: And then, like, you know, GETH requires the block number in hex, ref requires it in decimal,

106
00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:52.800
Chase Wright: That's something that has been brought up, that we'd like to standardize the debug set head, so we can unwind the execution clients, via the API. If that's something you could look into, that would… that would be helpful.

107
00:17:54.700 --> 00:18:01.679
Chase Wright: And other than that, I guess you could come into the ETH R&D Discord in the JSON RPC channel and

108
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.390
Chase Wright: and help… Help organize there as well.

109
00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.939
Chanderprakash: Yeah, sure. Thank you, thank you for this. I would like,

110
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:19.890
Chanderprakash: Prioritize these things that you mentioned, and, try to contribute meaningfully.

111
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:22.370
Chase Wright: Cool, thanks.

112
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:31.540
Chase Wright: Alright guys, I guess that's it. I don't have anything else, so… Let's chat offline.

113
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.360
Chase Wright: Have a good day.

114
00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:40.390
Tullio | Erigon: Okay. Have a nice day. Bye.
