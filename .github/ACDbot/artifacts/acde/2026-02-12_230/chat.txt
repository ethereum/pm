We wanted to increase the higher gas limit and without the data repricing we may run into limits.

00:22:39	Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind:	Replying to "Eth/71 for devnet 3 ..." 

 Are clients expected to store the access list to serve it? Unless you're an archive node, you will not be able to serve this for historical blocks

00:23:30	Karim T. (matkt):	Replying to "Eth/71 for devnet 3 ..."

We should keep them during a Weak Subjectivity Period
00:23:51	Karim T. (matkt):	And after we can prune them, so clients will be able to serve recent BALs
00:24:09	Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind:	Replying to "Eth/71 for devnet 3 ..." 

 But thats a short time, syncing clients will not really need them to catch up to the tip

00:47:21	lightclient:	we don’t have any efficient PQ encryption schemes in the protocol though
00:48:30	Gottfried Herold:	Replying to "we don’t have any ef..."

Note that the in-protocol part here is just using the released decryption key, which is a symmetric key, so PQ is not a big issue here.
00:49:38	Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz:	Replying to "we don’t have any ef..."

AES? That’s quantum-safe
00:49:46	Enrico Del Fante (tbenr):	Reacted to "AES? That’s quantum-..." with 💯
00:49:54	lightclient:	so we’d need AES precompile essentially?
00:49:56	Francesco:	Isn’t the decryption offchain?
00:50:05	lightclient:	but the code to decrypt is on chain?
00:52:16	Gottfried Herold:	Replying to "Isn’t the decryption..."

This uses a KEM - DEM framework, so the envelope includes an (pk encrypted) symmetric key.
The decryption of that is off-chain.
Using the then-revealed symmetric key is onchain, IIUC.
00:52:35	lightclient:	have encrypted mempools like this been deployed successfully out of protocol?
00:52:43	Potuz:	Replying to "but the code to decr..."

No, decryption is Offchain, you need to just check that the commitment from the open plaintext agrees to with the committed ticket.
00:53:50	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "have encrypted mempo..."

does Shutter network count?
00:55:00	Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz:	Replying to "Isn’t the decryption..."

Keep Kems offchain, they generally are as impacted as assymetric algos (EC, RSA) and have the same key size / sig size issues when going to PQ for KEM.  so off-chain KEM is best.
00:56:20	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "have encrypted mempo..."

otherwise, "like this" i would say is no, because lucid depends on focil/ePBS
00:56:35	Anders Elowsson:	Replying to "Isn’t the decryption..."

Benedikt Wagner has outlined one specification for this off-chain part included in Appendix C: https://ethresear.ch/t/lucid-encrypted-mempool-with-distributed-payload-propagation/24042#p-58297-appendix-c-kemdem-hybrid-encryption-51
