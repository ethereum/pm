Bonsai L1 cache 😂, I like the analogy with CPU L1 cache

I should maybe rename it like that
00:16:49	Stefan Starflinger:	This is just from the prometheus metrics and logs
00:16:55	Stefan Starflinger:	@geth what are the flags?

00:17:17	Ameziane Hamlat:	@Stefan Starflinger There may be an issue with the numbers, I don’t see how prefetch would help that much in reducing the reads
00:18:17	Dragan Rakita:	We figured out the problem that we had with EIP-7778 on devnet-2

I see, so that’s based only on the metrics on the flat database reads. As those reads are batched in advanced, besu doesn’t need to do it during execution.
00:19:56	Ameziane Hamlat:	Replying to "asked claude for a c..."

I think I understand now the results
00:20:16	Stefan Starflinger:	Replying to "asked claude for a c..."

I didn't question the numbers yet :D
00:20:47	Karim T. (matkt):	We said we should keep a minimum of BAL without pruning
00:21:10	Karim T. (matkt):	Something like 113056 blocks
00:23:23	felipe:	I wanted to note EELS has a branch of geth with support for opcode counts and has latest Amsterdam updates to t8n. I was able to fill some Amsterdam benchmark tests via these dev branches yesterday. We should be able to start building BAL-specific benchmark tests there soon.
00:23:49	spencer-tb:	Reacted to "I wanted to note EEL..." with ❤️
00:24:02	Karim T. (matkt):	For me BAL should also be available using P2P
00:25:00	spencer-tb:	Replying to "I wanted to note EEL..."

Does anyone know how we want to benchmark BAL specifically, parallel/serial/both <- for benchmark tests in EELS
00:25:39	jochem-brouwer:	Where is the eth/71 spec? Is it draft EIP?
00:26:05	Stefan Starflinger:	So what is the status on EEST benchmarking and benchmarkoor?

It's EELS all the way down now 🙂

00:35:10	Ameziane Hamlat:	In case of benchmarking BAL features, clients need to be benchmarked in separate VMs to have access to available cores and not fight on cores with other clients.
00:37:07	Barnabas:	I’d recommend holding back shadowforks till we have all EL clients confirmed working with BAL optimizations. As these are pretty expensive tests to run.
00:39:01	Toni Wahrstätter:	https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/pull/264/
00:40:27	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "https://github.com..."

FYI, here is eth/70 EIP: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7975
00:44:52	Karim T. (matkt):	What do you mean by “This check SHOULD be performed periodically (e.g., every 8 transactions) to enable early rejection without impacting parallel execution.” ?

Do you think this check will impact // execution ? Seems to be a light check
00:46:10	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "I’d recommend hol..."

Yes agreed, first focus on parallel execution and then later on state or sync which would require big state / shadowfork to bench correctly
00:48:54	jochem-brouwer:	This would be part of benchmark effort also I'd say (invalid BALs)
00:50:08	Marc:	implemented in nethermind
00:50:16	Barnabas:	can we get it merged?
00:50:19	Barnabas:	and add it to hive ?
00:51:22	Karim T. (matkt):	Is it eth_getBlockAccessListByBlockHash or eth_getBlockAccessListByHash
00:52:25	Karim T. (matkt):	yes
00:53:49	Ameziane Hamlat:	It is different from existing RPC we already have ex.
debug_traceBlockByHash and
debug_traceBlockByNumber
00:54:59	Karim T. (matkt):	We already have eth_getTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex
00:56:02	jochem-brouwer:	I think it is ambiguous because eth_getBlockAccessListByHash could mean BAL hash or BlockHash, while eth_getBlockAccessListByBlockHash is clear what the hash points to
00:56:06	Barnabas:	I think this is a call to be made in the rpc standard call
00:56:08	Barnabas:	lol
00:56:10	Karim T. (matkt):	Not sure eth_getBlockAccessListByHash you don’t know if it is the hash of BAL

00:57:24	jochem-brouwer:	This is also good for RPC consumers to let them chime in on here what would be a good practice :)
00:57:49	Ameziane Hamlat:	Reacted to "How about eth_getBlo..." with ➕
00:58:02	jochem-brouwer:	eth_simulate?
00:58:03	Barnabas:	eth_simulateV1
00:58:09	jochem-brouwer:	Heeft gereageerd op "eth_simulateV1" met 👍
00:58:11	felipe:	Reacted to "eth_simulateV1" with 👍
00:58:17	Stefan Starflinger:	Lets get all the hive tests passing otherwise all good from my end
00:58:21	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "eth_simulateV1"

Does it interact with BAL?
00:58:22	Karim T. (matkt):	Do you have a link to the spec of this RPC ?
00:58:27	Barnabas:	Replying to " eth_simulateV1 "

shouldn’t
00:58:34	Barnabas:	Replying to " eth_simulateV1 "

it will help us with benchmarking tho
00:58:38	jochem-brouwer:	Heeft gereageerd op "it will help us wi..." met 👍
00:58:46	Karim T. (matkt):	eth_simulateV2 ?
00:58:48	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "eth_simulateV1"

Ah right yes it could def. strain exec time
00:59:30	Barnabas:	Replying to "eth_simulateV2 ?"

https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/docs-api/api/methods/eth_simulateV1.mdx
00:59:38	Barnabas:	Replying to "eth_simulateV2 ?"

there is a v2?
00:59:39	Karim T. (matkt):	Replying to "eth_simulateV2 ?"

thanks
00:59:51	Karim T. (matkt):	Replying to "eth_simulateV2 ?"

No I was asking if you want a v2
01:00:22	Barnabas:	Replying to "eth_simulateV2 ?"

I want every client to implement v1
01:00:32	Barnabas:	Replying to "eth_simulateV2 ?"

as we still have a bunch of clients not having v1
01:01:54	Karim T. (matkt):	Replying to "eth_simulateV2 ?"

We have but are you asking to add BAL compatibility ?
01:02:26	Barnabas:	Suggestion for devnet 3 scope:

BAL OPTIMIZATIONS (parallel exec, parallel state loading, parallel state root calc) 
8037 State Creation Gas Cost Increase 
7954 Increase Maximum Contract Size
