00:58:09	Kevaundray Wedderburn:	Replying to "We should consider i..."

I think for verification it makes a lot of sense
00:58:10	Francesco Risitano:	@Justin Traglia the idea is that a validator A can equivocate. They can send an invalid proof to node B and send a valid proof to node C. Node B will now reject all proofs from Validator A so even if node C forwards the valid proof to node B they will reject it. Therefore there is a discrepancy / lack of consensus on what proofs are valid.

What do you refer to with usage, how well zkEVM utilizes the GPU compute resources?

01:04:57	Kevaundray Wedderburn:	Replying to "who has access to th..."

Currently it will be pandaOPs + EF zkEVM team
01:05:34	Yi Sun:	Replying to "How do we envision t..."

E.g. would we move to 6090 when released
01:05:38	Stefan Starflinger:	Replying to "How do we envision t..."

I assume new GPUs will always be around 10-10% more efficient and it would make sense over time to replace old hardware with new hardware.

01:10:36	Justin Traglia:	Replying to "@Justin Traglia the ..."

Hmm I see. This is a problem because provers cannot currently be slashed. Alternatively, we could allow/verify proofs from other peers if the proof is different, even if you received a bad proof before. There’s some level of trust that peers have successfully verified before forwarding. I’m a little worried that having everyone re-sign a 300KiB message will be a waste of resources.
01:11:50	Francesco Risitano:	Replying to "@Justin Traglia the ..."

Is the message size significant? I would assume you just sign a root?
01:12:15	Manu:	Replying to "We should consider i..."

Ideally the BN should call a lib for the verification, like done with the KZG lib.
01:12:19	Justin Traglia:	Replying to "@Justin Traglia the ..."

Oh, is that it? Maybe that’s not so bad.
01:13:01	Justin Traglia:	Replying to "We should consider i..."

I agree.
01:13:09	Francesco Risitano:	Replying to "We should consider i..."

Yeah I think we can integrate proof verification into the proof engine
01:13:56	Kevaundray Wedderburn:	Replying to "We should consider i..."
