00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.910
marek: Hey, Josh.

2
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.760
Maria Silva: And lowest one.

3
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.210
marek: Hello.

4
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:34.460
Maria Silva: I will suggest maybe we wait 1 or 2 minutes to see if more people join, and then we can start. Sounds good?

5
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.920
Justin Florentine (Besu): Sounds good. Basie Team's reporting in live from Portugal. Hello, everybody.

6
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.279
Maria Silva: Oh, really? Are you in Lisbon, or any other CP?

7
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.709
Justin Florentine (Besu): Here in Faro, in the south of Fortune.

8
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.120
Maria Silva: Wow! Oh, it's not the best time of year to be in Faro, but it's lovely.

9
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.410
Justin Florentine (Besu): West.

10
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.240
Maria Silva: So, I'll just, post the agenda.

11
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.070
Maria Silva: So you can see…

12
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:29.049
Maria Silva: And we still have a couple of people joining, but I think I'll just start by just going through the topics we are discussing today, and then if there's any other open topics people want to bring up, you are welcome to do so.

13
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.550
Maria Silva: So I will start with just…

14
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:42.259
Maria Silva: Showing, the current, timeline and to-dos for, for, for the EIPs. Then do a quick update on.

15
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:51.999
Maria Silva: the compute repricing, so 7904, and then also we have a few updates on the state growth, EIP, so AT37.

16
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.549
Maria Silva: And, finally, this is more of an FYI.

17
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:12.420
Maria Silva: that, Tony has, pushed today, a PR for, changing the specs for the data EIP, so 7976 and 7981.

18
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:20.280
Maria Silva: So, maybe we can… we can start, so I'll just try to share my screen.

19
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.899
Maria Silva: And show you the to-dos.

20
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.590
Maria Silva: Okay.

21
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:40.459
Maria Silva: So this is a page that I will try to keep as much updated as needed. So here you have an initial

22
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:52.809
Maria Silva: Timeline for when things need to be done, by what date, so that we can, by interop, have everything ready, on the repricing side.

23
00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:03.529
Maria Silva: And then here we have some… some goals for, the different, work streams that we are currently working on for

24
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:15.560
Maria Silva: February, but essentially, I just wanted to focus here on this first part so that I can give you, like, an overview of the key milestones and why things need to be done by what date.

25
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:22.030
Maria Silva: So the… the… the first thing is, by end of February.

26
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:37.509
Maria Silva: we need to have the preliminary numbers on, the EIP, so these means, mostly the things missing are 7904, so the compute EIP, and the state access EIP, so the AD38.

27
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:52.909
Maria Silva: So that we can start running a backward compatibility analysis and start, engaging with the community with those preliminary numbers. Also, by the end of February, it's important for us to have all the tooling.

28
00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:07.990
Maria Silva: ready to then compute the final numbers. And what does this mean? So this means that we need to have the balls optimizations in place, so that we can run our benchmarks, using… taking into account the optimizations.

29
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:18.120
Maria Silva: We also need to run things on the Fusaka fork, which, for the preliminary numbers, we are still using Prague.

30
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.479
Maria Silva: So this will give us more, more accurate numbers.

31
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:35.960
Maria Silva: And besides having, like, all this tooling ready, we will also have the specs for the IPs, and this is more important for AT37, so by the end of February, because

32
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:48.649
Maria Silva: 8037 is… is the one with more open questions. The idea is to have the specs, closed, by that date. So, in March, we can start,

33
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.749
Maria Silva: Doing the benchmarks and analysis for the final numbers.

34
00:05:52.920 --> 00:06:01.779
Maria Silva: And by the end of March, we have those final numbers, and we can have the definite width.

35
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:18.230
Maria Silva: balls and all the repricings, integrated. And then in April, that gives us time to then do testing, security analysis, and so, so forth. And I would say also during March, we will be doing more community outreach and, and,

36
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:26.319
Maria Silva: collecting potential issues from the repricing so that we can fix them during April. So this is the…

37
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:44.459
Maria Silva: the general rollout, and I think this kind of stresses, again, the need for… by the end of February, we have a good set of clients with the main optimizations for block-level access lists done, so that we can benchmark them and make sure that the numbers we have.

38
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.470
Maria Silva: for all the EIPs makes sense.

39
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:54.320
Maria Silva: Does this timeline make sense to you? Do you have any comments, any feedback?

40
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:20.199
Maria Silva: Okay, so if not, you are also welcome to read this, async and, just, ping me with comments.

41
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.589
Maria Silva: It would be super helpful.

42
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:31.080
Maria Silva: For… so then we can move to the next point of the agenda. So on the computes,

43
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.650
Maria Silva: VIP.

44
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.990
Maria Silva: So, as you…

45
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:48.070
Maria Silva: should remember, the initial EIP was a general repricing that was making all the operations that could be cheaper, cheaper. But during the

46
00:07:48.560 --> 00:08:07.170
Maria Silva: discussion of the EIP's inclusion, we had this understanding of, let's reduce the scope of this EIP to focus just on a couple of operations that are current bottlenecks, so making things more expensive, and then don't change the price of anything else.

47
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:13.279
Maria Silva: And so… the, I've started to update the EIP,

48
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:20.650
Maria Silva: To be in line with that, so I don't think… I'm checking, I don't think I linked the…

49
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:21.750
Maria Silva: Yikes.

50
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:28.859
Maria Silva: PR in the agenda. I didn't, but I will share in the chat and then share after also.

51
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:40.400
Maria Silva: But the… The general format is that now we are repricing only 13 operations.

52
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.120
Maria Silva: And I can maybe show you… how DEIP looks like.

53
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.549
Maria Silva: Let me just see if I can share my screen again.

54
00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.140
Maria Silva: Okay…

55
00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:14.609
Maria Silva: Okay, so, the way it is looking now is we are repricing these 13 operations.

56
00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:34.339
Maria Silva: So, these are the ones that are performing worse than 60 milligars per second, and that the… so, and this is the worst client, so the worst client is performing at less than 60 milligars per second, and also,

57
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:41.830
Maria Silva: The difference between the worst and the second worst is not too large, so this means that these operations are not something that

58
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:57.579
Maria Silva: could be optimized is mostly, like, an underperforming, or an operation that is difficult to be performing better. And we already talked with the Bezo team about this, and all the operations that are worse than this.

59
00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:07.530
Maria Silva: Or, to put these more specifically, all the pure compute operations, because we still have the state operations, but the pure compute operations that perform

60
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:15.900
Maria Silva: worse than 60… Million gas per second and are not here are things that the team is,

61
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:20.079
Maria Silva: Signal that they could optimize by…

62
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.979
Maria Silva: By the time of the fork.

63
00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:34.530
Maria Silva: Again, these numbers are still not final-final, and the reason for that is that, first, this was run on the Prague fork, not Osaka.

64
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:40.639
Maria Silva: And we still need to run this again with Prague, then also doesn't take into account block-level access lists.

65
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:46.630
Maria Silva: Optimizations, so maybe some numbers will actually be,

66
00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:56.720
Maria Silva: much different after we take that into consideration. And third, there are a couple of tests here that seem to have increases that are

67
00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:05.009
Maria Silva: So as an example, like, for Ketchup, the message size is not…

68
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:09.810
Maria Silva: an increase, and even ADMOD is not having an increase, and the reason for that

69
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:29.090
Maria Silva: Is that likely there's some caching or some, thing in the test that we need to double-check? And so this is… this final number doesn't match the worst-case block we are seeing, in the other tests. And so there's… there's still some… some work, to do here and to verify, but this is

70
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:45.709
Maria Silva: more the shape of the EIP now, so you have just a couple of operations and pre-compiles. Things are becoming more expensive, and, instead of just having, like, a single, like, a reprice where everything becomes cheaper.

71
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.039
Maria Silva: Any comments or questions?

72
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.719
Justin Florentine (Besu): Yeah, sorry, I have a question.

73
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:12.639
Justin Florentine (Besu): So, from what I understand, add mode, for example, stays the same, but div and SDIV are, like, 3 or 4 times,

74
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:25.140
Justin Florentine (Besu): Right. More expensive? So, what's the… what's the… what's the rationale? Because now, DIV is more expensive than even mill mode.

75
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:36.350
Maria Silva: Yeah, so I think this is the point where we need to go back to the tests and make sure that the runtimes we are seeing are correct, but this

76
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:41.180
Maria Silva: Numbers are completely coming directly from

77
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:59.200
Maria Silva: the benchmarks. So, it's… it's… it's… there's no, like, rationale behind it, is we are measuring how much a block of these opcodes takes to run, then we estimate the cost of a single opcode running based on

78
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:18.049
Maria Silva: So we exclude, like, the… the fixed costs of setting up these blocks, so we try to isolate as much the other opcodes and just get to the… how much a single opcode takes… takes to run. Then we check what is the worst-case client, and then we transform that from

79
00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:25.579
Maria Silva: Runtime to gas using the conversion rate of the 60 million gas per second.

80
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:29.819
Maria Silva: So this is how these numbers arrive. And so…

81
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:42.330
Maria Silva: So the fact that, for instance, admonth doesn't have an increase while DIF and SDIV do, this is the point where we need to go back to the text and make sure that things, make sense there.

82
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.320
Justin Florentine (Besu): Thank you.

83
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:51.869
Maria Silva: Ben?

84
00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:01.020
Ben Adams: Sorry. Just to follow up on Moldmod,

85
00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:05.660
Ben Adams: I'd look at the, 256-bit.

86
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:15.390
Ben Adams: Mods, because they're used as the output for… Mmm…

87
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:21.890
Ben Adams: Yeah, they're used for some of the outputs, and they're quite common, and they're also significantly worse than

88
00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:23.400
Ben Adams: With small muds.

89
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:32.130
Ben Adams: Also, I'd want to raise, point evaluation is increasing, and that… is…

90
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:36.180
Ben Adams: The number in the, blob base fee.

91
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:42.250
Ben Adams: Floor, so… That should have a knock-on on tests, because it should…

92
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:48.050
Ben Adams: If we're to follow this through correctly, it should, increase that.

93
00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.589
Ben Adams: That floor price.

94
00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:51.870
Maria Silva: Right.

95
00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.560
Maria Silva: And do you think that should be a desired,

96
00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.080
Maria Silva: Knock… knockout effect, or shouldn't it be?

97
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:06.790
Ben Adams: I think it should be a desired knock-on effect, because it's meant to capture

98
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:11.210
Ben Adams: The cost of doing the point evaluations, so… Yeah.

99
00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:17.460
Ben Adams: Right. If we're… if we're increasing. I mean, it's… it's, it's a… it's a low floor anyway, so it's not…

100
00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:19.249
Ben Adams: Not, like, a huge increase.

101
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:20.800
Ben Adams: Boat.

102
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.350
Maria Silva: Right.

103
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:26.439
Ben Adams: To stick to the formula, it should… it should use the updated value.

104
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:35.829
Maria Silva: Okay, so that's… that's a good point, and maybe I will add it, to… to… to the EIP, so it doesn't,

105
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.010
Maria Silva: So we don't miss it when we are doing the specs.

106
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.320
Maria Silva: Any more comments?

107
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.159
Maria Silva: Okay, so I'll stop.

108
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:04.640
Maria Silva: Sharing, my screen.

109
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:08.990
Maria Silva: And then we can go to the…

110
00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:19.279
Maria Silva: Next item in the agenda, so 8037, can I check, is Francisco in the call?

111
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.619
Maria Silva: I think so.

112
00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:39.990
Maria Silva: Okay, so, Francisco, can you give a quick update on the specs for 8037? You worked on them, like, a few weeks ago, so you could… if you could just give us, like, a view on what is done, and in your view, what are the open questions?

113
00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:44.390
Francesco: Yeah, I mean…

114
00:16:44.910 --> 00:17:09.869
Francesco: like I said, I haven't worked on it in a while, so it's not, like, a super, maybe up-to-date view, but I tried to, like, take a look again. So, I mean, what is there right now? I think it mostly matches what's in the IP, especially after we had updated that, table with the gas costs. I can link them later. I think there's, like, a few small differences in the IP in, like, maybe naming of some

115
00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:23.090
Francesco: things, and maybe already there's some regular gas costs that are added there that are not in the EIP, but I think, like, yeah, most things are as in the EIP. I think the main questions I still had open…

116
00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:32.169
Francesco: We're, which, yeah, same as in DAIP, they're not really… it's not, like, things that really, like, came out of, kind of, you know, nitty-gritty of the specs, it's more like…

117
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:41.750
Francesco: this high-level questions of the EAP, is, like, the regular gas costs, like, for basically any time that we have an operation where we're kind of unbundling.

118
00:17:41.750 --> 00:18:04.230
Francesco: state gas, and regular gas, there's a question of, like, exactly how to do it, and I think for most of them, it's fairly straightforward. Like, there's already a pretty clear distinction in how the gas costs were historically written. There's places where that's not the case. I think that chiefly, that's create. So for create, there's some regular gas costs, but there's not really anything that's

119
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:21.270
Francesco: capturing, basically, the actual, cost of, of, making the new account, other than the, the… or rather, there, like, there is, but it's just this one number, GasCreate, that's kind of bundling both the state growth

120
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:45.790
Francesco: part of it, which is what we kind of want to split out into, state gas, and then everything else, so, which might be, I don't know, like, try operations and whatever else. And so this other thing, it's not right now named in any way, I think, neither in the IP nor in the specs, and it's not even clear, like, what it should be, like, numerically, like, what is this cost and, like, how does it compare to other costs that we have.

121
00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.250
Francesco: I mean, I guess it might be…

122
00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:52.159
Francesco: Maybe somewhat comparable to… to,

123
00:18:52.630 --> 00:19:05.269
Francesco: like a storage update or something like that, but, like, yeah, the precise way that we should come to this number, I think no one has really, like, thought to too much. So that's one question. Another question was around…

124
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.320
Francesco: Yeah, kind of similarly in this, like.

125
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:16.329
Francesco: How… well, once we split up… split out operations and we have the state gas component,

126
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:30.490
Francesco: maybe, like, in some cases, it's worth also revisiting. So, but yeah, I guess, very explicitly, like, basically, we have, in the S-Store case, the update case versus the, like, new slot case.

127
00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:48.029
Francesco: And it's not clear that these should be priced exactly the same in regular gas. Maybe it's fine to just do that. It's, you know, maybe not the biggest difference in the world. But yeah, like, we can, you know, in… they're gonna be differentiated by the fact that one of the two has a state gas component, which

128
00:19:48.030 --> 00:20:07.060
Francesco: is about state growth, but even the regular gas component maybe should be different, because it's just not really the same to do a try insertion versus an update. So that's, like, yeah, another kind of small question, whether we care about this, and if so, then what is the right way to go about it?

129
00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:20.669
Francesco: There was a question around receipts, which, I don't know, I have not followed, kind of, the parallel discussion on this, for the other EIP, so maybe, yeah, that one we should first, kind of.

130
00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:29.109
Francesco: someone should, like, summarize what happened there, and then we can see how does it apply to, to the CIP.

131
00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:39.169
Francesco: And… yeah, one last question, which I just noticed in the specs, was that basically, with this, like, reservoir mechanism for… for state gas.

132
00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:49.539
Francesco: Or, like, as part of this mechanism, and how it enables to enforce some kind of, transaction max gas limit.

133
00:20:49.790 --> 00:21:02.049
Francesco: like, not anymore as a validity condition, but somewhat during execution. We were not, or at least I was not, I don't know how… I don't remember how Marius' prototype did, and I'm not sure if this is, like.

134
00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:16.450
Francesco: Written in this way in the EIP. I was not enforcing this on intrinsic gas, or, like, intrinsic regular gas, which, yeah, I think should be the case. Like, I think this should basically be, like, checked for,

135
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:20.679
Francesco: The max of intrinsic regular gas and cold data floor gas cost.

136
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.750
Francesco: Upfront, so you should, like, just ensure that…

137
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.520
Francesco: the max of these two does not go over the cap. And then…

138
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:47.639
Francesco: intrinsic regular gas should kind of be subtracted from… from, the… from this, like, 16 million number, or 16.7 million number, when you actually pass the… the… the gas that's, basically, like, the… the allowed regular gas to the… to the actual execution.

139
00:21:48.410 --> 00:22:02.330
Francesco: this was probably too many things, but yeah, okay. If there's anything there that, made sense and people want to, like, try to zoom in into, let me know. Otherwise, I can write, like, a small recap in the chat.

140
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:17.040
Maria Silva: So I… so I think I have two questions there. So the first is on the transaction receipts. Is anyone here on the call, familiar with this?

141
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:22.460
Maria Silva: Open question, and can give more insights, or… Or not.

142
00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.460
Maria Silva: If not, I'll try to…

143
00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:31.239
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, I can… I can… I can provide some insights. So this was regarding EAP7778.

144
00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:32.800
Toni Wahrstätter: and…

145
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:38.420
Toni Wahrstätter: There was the discussion if it should add a new field to the receipt, which would be the gas spend.

146
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.130
Toni Wahrstätter: Because,

147
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:48.670
Toni Wahrstätter: Because of 7778, the gas accounting for the block will deviate from the gas accounting that the user pays, so on the transaction level.

148
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:58.089
Toni Wahrstätter: And in the end, we reverted back to not adding a new view to the receipt. So everything stays the same there. And I would assume that

149
00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:01.300
Toni Wahrstätter: 8037 would probably prefer.

150
00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.999
Toni Wahrstätter: So, add a new filter receipt.

151
00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:07.679
Toni Wahrstätter: From the 7778 discussion.

152
00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:15.360
Toni Wahrstätter: Aragon was opposed to adding a new field to the receipt, because it added, like, a few weeks more work for them.

153
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:17.549
Toni Wahrstätter: This is for the recall.

154
00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:26.419
Ben Adams: Was that just adding a new field, or,

155
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.939
Ben Adams: Changing what the cumulative guess meant.

156
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:38.629
Ben Adams: I still think we should add a new field, because otherwise there's, like, this weird gap that you have to trace the block in order to…

157
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.489
Ben Adams: I mean, that's not even in tracing.

158
00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.499
Ben Adams: To find why there's a difference between the transactions and the…

159
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:48.630
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, maybe you're right. Maybe,

160
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:55.049
Toni Wahrstätter: Not the field as the problem, but the semantics of what cumulative gas means in the receipt.

161
00:23:55.300 --> 00:24:01.390
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, if someone from Aragon is here, they can clarify. Otherwise, we can find out.

162
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:07.810
Toni Wahrstätter: But you would say, Ben, like, adding receipt, adding fields to a receipt is not a big thing?

163
00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:13.440
Ben Adams: No, it's a bit annoying, but no.

164
00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:35.730
Francesco: Yeah, I just wanted to add that, like, from the AD37 perspective, it's really, like, it's kind of a similar problem, that, like, now cumulative gas, it's unclear what it should mean. If it means something that's useful to users, like, something where you can do the diff and get the transaction gas used, like, the actual consumption of the transaction.

165
00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:40.120
Francesco: Then it's gonna diverge from the block, cumulative guess?

166
00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:48.040
Francesco: So, yeah, I mean, which, maybe it's fine, like, if the whole thing is just about users being able to do this diff, then, okay, we could just…

167
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.010
Francesco: interpreted that way.

168
00:24:51.220 --> 00:25:00.169
Francesco: If not, then it should somehow… there should be something that's also tracking block consumption, then I think there have to be two numbers, basically.

169
00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:14.359
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, I'm wondering if this even needs the receipt at all. So why would we even put something into the receipt? We can completely shield it from the user, because the user doesn't…

170
00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:20.440
Toni Wahrstätter: need to know that value, right? Or do you… do you think users will be interested in how much,

171
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.200
Toni Wahrstätter: Gas they spent on a specific resource.

172
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:29.180
Ben Adams: I mean, it's… it's good that… for…

173
00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:37.799
Ben Adams: Not necessarily for users, but for doing analysis to work out where… Where the resources have gone.

174
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.800
Ben Adams: Because otherwise, there's no way of… evaluating…

175
00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:49.630
Ben Adams: What it is, and for people doing, like, accounting on… Using the data.

176
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:55.260
Ben Adams: Do you have to run a validator, or can you just use the data coming from the receipts and…

177
00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:56.750
Ben Adams: blog.

178
00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:59.710
Ben Adams: To, you know, work out.

179
00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.250
Ben Adams: How much… how much state's increased, and all sorts of other things.

180
00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.609
Ben Adams: Refunds are being given out where they are.

181
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:20.080
Maria Silva: Okay, so, so my understanding on this point is that, it's a trade-off between

182
00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:33.639
Maria Silva: Making receipts a bit more user-friendly for the people doing… trying to analyze the exact cost conception versus the additional work of changing receipts.

183
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.080
Maria Silva: Is this a fair assessment?

184
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:47.830
Maria Silva: Tony, you were saying that you think this doesn't even need to touch these seeds?

185
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:50.130
Ben Adams: Oh.

186
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:56.509
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, this is just my initial feeling, that we might just not even need to touch the receipts, and it's all fine.

187
00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:03.609
Ben Adams: I mean, one of… one of the reasons for ETH transfers amid a log is because

188
00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:11.050
Ben Adams: The receipts are missing some data, so in order to… to get that data, you have to…

189
00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.340
Ben Adams: Tracer block.

190
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:15.880
Ben Adams: And… If we don't put

191
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:21.469
Ben Adams: The additional data in the receipts were back in that place where we have new.

192
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:22.390
Toni Wahrstätter: Right.

193
00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:39.710
Toni Wahrstätter: Right, but we don't tell users how much gas they spent on state creation today. So, from a user perspective, I wouldn't actually care if there is a new value in the receipt that tells me how much gas I spent on state creation, for example. I only care about the gas used.

194
00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:41.780
Toni Wahrstätter: That I eventually paid.

195
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.890
Ben Adams: But we're not… we're not pricing it differently.

196
00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.769
Ben Adams: Whereas now, we will be.

197
00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:53.390
Ben Adams: You know, we're not differentiating state creation at the moment.

198
00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:55.720
Ben Adams: Whereas after this, we are.

199
00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:02.040
Ben Adams: So it might be, like, I only did a tiny bit of compute, why am I being charged so much?

200
00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:17.280
Toni Wahrstätter: I'm not sure, I'm not sure, because you don't get a rational for how much you're charged today. So, in the end, what the user cares is how much is the user's account charged.

201
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:21.829
Toni Wahrstätter: No matter how we got there. This simplifies it a lot, because…

202
00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:24.590
Toni Wahrstätter: We get away without those changes.

203
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:28.960
Maria Silva: Checking…

204
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:44.140
Maria Silva: it seems to me like the… the behavior that Ben wouldn't like to see is us just giving the regular gas spent. So, but if we had a sum of the regular gas plus the state gas, that would be

205
00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.859
Maria Silva: Evalent what we have right now, right?

206
00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.019
Ben Adams: Yeah, I mean, if the data can be…

207
00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:03.489
Ben Adams: It doesn't need to be explicitly there, but if it can be derived, that's…

208
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:22.960
Maria Silva: Okay, so on, Francesco's points, I guess, like, the last point was the one that I didn't fully understand. So, the reservoir,

209
00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:29.309
Maria Silva: points, and I saw that, Francesco, you wrote something here.

210
00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:31.360
Francesco: Yeah, I'm in the…

211
00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.100
Maria Silva: Is transaction max limit enforcement.

212
00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:48.650
Francesco: Yeah, it's… yeah, it's about that. Basically, I just… at least, I mean, in my version of the spec, the… this wasn't bound in the intrinsic gas consumption, it was just bound in the execution gas. Like, we were just doing this,

213
00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:53.979
Francesco: basically give up to transaction max gets limit.

214
00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:59.820
Francesco: execution as, like, gas during execution, outside of the reservoir, so there would be, like.

215
00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:22.509
Francesco: this, like, up to $16.7 million for execution, and then potentially a reservoir to draw from for state gas. But that's the only place where this kind of enforcement was happening, and so, for example, you could use much more call data than that, or just, I don't know, in principle, use during… for intrinsic reg… intrinsic gas stuff could go over the limit.

216
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:34.669
Francesco: And yeah, I guess just the… the question is just agreeing that we don't want that, that we actually want to enforce it also for intrinsic gas. I mean, this seems clear to me, but yeah, I guess we didn't, like, explicitly discuss this.

217
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:43.780
Maria Silva: Okay, sounds good. So it seems like it's not as much as an open question, but it's something we should add to the EIP and the specs.

218
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:59.129
Francesco: Yeah, I mean, I guess maybe, like, in terms of question is whether we… what do we want to do with the call data floor cost there? I was thinking this would also be enforced to be less than transaction max cost limit, like, as if

219
00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:06.759
Francesco: the call data was actually priced at the higher, cost, like, for the purpose of this limit, but yeah, I guess that's…

220
00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:12.909
Francesco: I don't know, just an opinion, it's maybe not obvious that that should be the case.

221
00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:18.730
Francesco: And I mean, I guess in general, there's the question of, like, what is the purpose of enforcing this limit for, for,

222
00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:23.500
Francesco: Call data and, like, these other things that are not really execution, but…

223
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:34.869
Francesco: I guess enforcing it is, like, the most consistent thing with the current spec, and I mean, maybe there's an argument that, okay, eventually, in any way is helpful to ensure that transactions cannot be too big in terms of call data.

224
00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:39.760
Maria Silva: I think… I think that would make… would make sense to me.

225
00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:48.280
Maria Silva: Okay, any more comments on this point, or should we move to the next one?

226
00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:04.069
Maria Silva: Okay, so, moving to the next… I'm not sure, is Anders in the call?

227
00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.880
Justin Florentine (Besu): Oh, no, go?

228
00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.480
Maria Silva: Yes? Sorry.

229
00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:11.400
Justin Florentine (Besu): Before we jump onto another one.

230
00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:20.120
Justin Florentine (Besu): I'll ask a question there. What about the refunds? And Mizanne posted the IP I was talking about. Should there?

231
00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:33.059
Justin Florentine (Besu): I wonder if that should be integrated with the state growth CIP, to split up the regular gas from the state gas. Should we subtract the refunds from the state gas?

232
00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:38.319
Justin Florentine (Besu): Instead, like, kind of integrating both the IPs in a way.

233
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:44.180
Maria Silva: Right, so that's… that's a good point.

234
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:52.660
Maria Silva: So, my intuition is that it would make sense to integrate them, but I think we need to…

235
00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:55.259
Maria Silva: To think a bit more on this.

236
00:32:56.410 --> 00:33:00.759
Maria Silva: I think, Francesco, you were going to say something, then you muted again.

237
00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:05.659
Francesco: Yeah, I didn't fully understand what you mean by discounted from state gas.

238
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:19.540
Ben Adams: As in… I… If you, if you write, if you write something…

239
00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:35.350
Ben Adams: you're using state gas, but… sorry, if you create a new field, you're creating state gas, but if you delete something, you get a refund. Would that come? You know, if your net change is zero, in terms of added state issue.

240
00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:51.700
Francesco: Right, so I… the way I'm doing it right now in the spec for simplicity is to really just keep the current refund mechanism, so with the refund counter and all that, and it's applied, to the transaction gas used, at the end, which is… and transaction…

241
00:33:51.700 --> 00:34:12.120
Francesco: consumption is, like, the sum of regular gas and state gas. So basically, like, you track state gas and regular gas during execution separately, but then for the purpose of figuring out how much the transaction actually pay, you just take the sum, and then take the refunds from there, like, with the same mechanism that we have today, with the, you know, 20% rule and all that.

242
00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:15.579
Francesco: So it's, it's really actually completely unmodified.

243
00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:28.389
Francesco: from how it is today. Then, of course, we could be more… trying to do more, and, for example, really say that if you netted zero state, then you should fully get back the state gas that you received.

244
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:42.599
Francesco: It is a bit more involved, like, it would just require a bit more tracking to… during execution to make sure that you only do this, when, like, a call doesn't revert to… in which, like, state has been cleared or things like that, but it can be done.

245
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:47.169
Francesco: But again, I just chose not to do it because it felt like, in a way, almost like…

246
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:59.970
Francesco: out of the scope of the IP, like, trying to do something else, that… and, yeah, the one place that I am doing this in, because there… it worked out really easily, is the,

247
00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:12.360
Francesco: 7702 refund when the account already exists. This is, like, before the transaction, and there it was, yeah, just very easy to just completely remove this state gas consumption.

248
00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:20.440
Francesco: But yeah, I don't know, I mean, we could do this, just, it didn't seem necessary when, like, it seems like the current refund mechanism

249
00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:29.710
Francesco: can work basically out of the box with this, essentially. If we're not trying to do, like, basically make it better for users.

250
00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:50.320
Maria Silva: Okay, so maybe it's something we can think a bit more about and see if the added work, has benefits, or if we should just… I would say maybe as a starting point, we can just leave it at is, and then…

251
00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.289
Maria Silva: Put it as an open question for… for later.

252
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:56.029
Maria Silva: Does that sound good, Louise?

253
00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:07.769
Maria Silva: I think the Bezo team is muted. Not sure if you are answering, but…

254
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:10.439
Justin Florentine (Besu): Yeah, yeah, I was starting to speak there.

255
00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:26.709
Justin Florentine (Besu): Yeah, well, at least I just threw the idea out there. To me, it looks like, from a conceptual point of view, a clean… it would be clean to… because these refunds, to me, look like incentives to the storage… to the storage side.

256
00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:32.979
Justin Florentine (Besu): It looked like… it would look like they could fit very well in the steakhouse.

257
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.810
Justin Florentine (Besu): Remix.

258
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:37.190
Justin Florentine (Besu): But yeah, it's something to think about.

259
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:43.810
Ben Adams: And remove… remove the refund from execution, so…

260
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:46.580
Ben Adams: And just have it on state gas, is that correct?

261
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:51.119
Justin Florentine (Besu): Sorry, Ben, you said repeated.

262
00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:57.339
Ben Adams: Remove the… Remove the refund from the execution side entirely, and just have a…

263
00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:58.019
Justin Florentine (Besu): That's a refund.

264
00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:59.890
Ben Adams: and on… Right, thanks.

265
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.120
Justin Florentine (Besu): Exactly, exactly.

266
00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:15.089
Maria Silva: Okay, any more comments on these, or should we move to the next agenda point?

267
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:30.660
Maria Silva: Perfect. So do we have endors in the call? He had a comment on an analysis he did.

268
00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.590
Maria Silva: I'm not seeing him.

269
00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:47.930
Maria Silva: No. And maybe I can just, link to it and give a quick overview. But essentially, so Anders was analyzing

270
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:55.090
Maria Silva: This question of, how the new…

271
00:37:55.290 --> 00:38:03.459
Maria Silva: Way that we meter gas impact space fee, and then Resource consumption overall.

272
00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:12.170
Maria Silva: And so he did this nice visual of these two failure modes. So once we have the max function.

273
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:19.950
Maria Silva: to define, how full a block is. Essentially, you start to have this bottleneck resource. So.

274
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:34.379
Maria Silva: If a block is using more regular gas than state gas, then the regular gas is the bottleneck, and this is the resource that will then influence how much the base fee increases in the next block. And so.

275
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:48.750
Maria Silva: Depending on the relative demand between these two resources, essentially you can have these two situations, where in one case, the regular gas is the bottleneck resource, and so,

276
00:38:49.240 --> 00:39:04.089
Maria Silva: In this case, the state creation is a bit lower than if it was being used up to the target. I say this failure mode is okay, because, I mean, we are still

277
00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:21.170
Maria Silva: processing at max throughput in terms of other resources, and we are not growing state too much, so I think this failure mode is okay. I think the one that is a bit more worried, or worrisome, is the failure mode 2, where

278
00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:24.920
Maria Silva: Actually, the state gas is the bottleneck resource.

279
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:33.310
Maria Silva: And in this case, we end up… Having less, or using less.

280
00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:47.129
Maria Silva: gas for regular gas than what we could, and so it means that our burst, or the compute resources and the state taxes resources are a bit underutilized.

281
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:54.649
Maria Silva: And so, and this has an impact on which, how much we price state growth.

282
00:39:54.840 --> 00:40:13.710
Maria Silva: In relation to compute, and also what aggregation function do you use? Like, is the max the right function, or should we use another function? And I don't want to go into much detail here, but I'll also link to an analysis I posted,

283
00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:24.539
Maria Silva: Today, that, actually, link to both analyses, if you want to check.

284
00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:41.459
Maria Silva: But essentially, here, in this analysis, I'm taking into consideration the possibility of different demands.

285
00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:53.430
Maria Silva: For… or different demand values for regular gas and state gas, and how the different possible combinations of these two values would impact throughput

286
00:40:53.500 --> 00:41:02.149
Maria Silva: and state growth under the different aggregation functions. And so at the end of the day, I think,

287
00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:21.909
Maria Silva: we can have, I think this is something we need to continue to discuss and analyze, so I'll put here the analysis, and if you have, like, any comments or questions, I'll be happy to discuss it more in depth.

288
00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:34.180
Maria Silva: Yeah, so I… I think this is what I wanted to present for these two

289
00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:43.280
Maria Silva: points, and just to clarify that, I think the… the view we take on these will have an impact on the final

290
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:56.769
Maria Silva: design for AT37, and how much we… so what is the increase, in… in state gas versus the regular gas that we defined there?

291
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:05.859
Maria Silva: Are there any comments on this point?

292
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.900
Maria Silva: Okay,

293
00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:40.019
Maria Silva: If not, maybe we can just move to the final point. So, it's just an FYI that, Tony has, opened a PR for the data.

294
00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:53.350
Maria Silva: EIP, so 7976 and 79881. If you have any comments on those, and if you have time to check it and review it, it would be much appreciated.

295
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:56.750
Maria Silva: And… yep.

296
00:42:57.130 --> 00:43:03.180
Maria Silva: I don't think I have more points on the agenda. Are there any open… yes, Ben?

297
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:15.330
Ben Adams: I'd just like to add an FYI on the 7… sorry, T780, which is the, transfer prices?

298
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:16.740
Ben Adams: Yes.

299
00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.859
Ben Adams: So, in the ETH…

300
00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:27.039
Ben Adams: Eth transfers a middle log. There is no prices for the log, it's essentially free, and

301
00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:32.569
Ben Adams: That's because… ETH transfers are so massively overpriced.

302
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:43.680
Ben Adams: And in… 2780, we're bringing it all down and doing it by component parts. But…

303
00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:51.769
Ben Adams: because of that, there's… there is no longer any slack for, you know, just putting the log in, so I'm gonna add

304
00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:56.779
Ben Adams: charging for the ETH transfer logs. It's not a huge amount, but

305
00:43:57.570 --> 00:44:06.079
Ben Adams: in… in principle, how it's derived, the… the prices, or the transactions and so forth. It's… it's based on…

306
00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:17.079
Ben Adams: the costs of the parts, so there isn't any slack to say, oh yeah, we'll just say these are free. I mean, it'll still be significantly cheaper than now.

307
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:23.559
Ben Adams: But that will be an… unless there's any objections, that will be a… Another component that's included.

308
00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:29.889
Maria Silva: to me.

309
00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:34.330
Maria Silva: Tony, do you want to add anything?

310
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:36.700
Maria Silva: Or do you have a different point?

311
00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.210
Maria Silva: Race.

312
00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:45.299
Toni Wahrstätter: a different point, so if someone wants to add something to Ben's point, I would just wait.

313
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:46.720
Maria Silva: Okay.

314
00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:47.130
jochem-brouwer: Oh, yeah.

315
00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:47.980
Maria Silva: He'll come to you.

316
00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:57.539
jochem-brouwer: Yeah, yeah, I have one question. So, Ben, you were saying, because it's correct, like, the logs are currently free, I think, by the current spec.

317
00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:04.209
jochem-brouwer: But if you do an EV transfer for, via call, they have to pay 9K, so if you have a non-zero,

318
00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:08.380
jochem-brouwer: transfer, you have to pay 9K or maybe 5K, but at least this is priced in.

319
00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:17.560
jochem-brouwer: But are you saying that you want to split up this 9K into, like, a specific component for the log and for the transfer, or…

320
00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:25.170
Ben Adams: Well… 2780 also brings down the cost for calls, so the

321
00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:29.859
Ben Adams: the transaction and calls are greatly reduced for an ETH transfer.

322
00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:35.150
Ben Adams: So I'd put the… I'd add the log back onto both of them.

323
00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:37.539
Ben Adams: If ETH is being transferred.

324
00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:44.760
jochem-brouwer: Alright, sorry, I confused these ERPs. I'm seeing you were talking about 278. Yeah, sorry, sorry, yeah.

325
00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:49.329
Ben Adams: Yeah, so the 9K transfer cost per call comes down significantly also.

326
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.770
Ben Adams: But because…

327
00:45:53.510 --> 00:46:06.140
Ben Adams: because it comes down for only what it's doing, we also have to add… we'll have to add the ETH transfer… sorry, the log cost onto that, because it's, you know, additional work that…

328
00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:08.499
Ben Adams: Not in its pricing currently.

329
00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:20.209
jochem-brouwer: Yeah, yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense, because then it… yeah, you will basically split up the cost of this for the transfer cost and also, like, the login cost. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

330
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:33.130
Maria Silva: Okay, any more comments or questions on Ben's point?

331
00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:41.990
Maria Silva: Perfect. If not, Tony, do you want to raise your point?

332
00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:49.449
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, just as a heads up regarding EAP7976, this is the cold data cost increase.

333
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:54.190
Toni Wahrstätter: So right now, it's a very simple constant increase from…

334
00:46:54.320 --> 00:47:02.699
Toni Wahrstätter: 10 per call data token to 15. But there's also this discussion Happening, if we should…

335
00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:11.089
Toni Wahrstätter: harmonize the call data cost at the floor, which means we would change the ERP slightly, such that users

336
00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:17.309
Toni Wahrstätter: Pay the same call data cost as today, at least, not hitting the floor, so 4 and 16.

337
00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:28.670
Toni Wahrstätter: And then, if the call data cost outweighs execution, like in the 7623 model, Then, we charge $64.64.

338
00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.510
Toni Wahrstätter: So the same cost per byte, because…

339
00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:42.719
Toni Wahrstätter: At this point, basically blocks are getting so large that it doesn't matter anymore if it's a zero byte or a non-zero byte. Compression will not profit a lot from having a zero byte.

340
00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:54.280
Toni Wahrstätter: So, it makes sense to price them the same. And the nice effect this would have is that we would only hit this 10MB limit that we are always, talking about.

341
00:47:54.710 --> 00:48:05.190
Toni Wahrstätter: I think it's in the engine API, but I don't even recall, that we only hit that limit when we are at 650 million gas. And otherwise, we would hit it at 150 million.

342
00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:18.380
Toni Wahrstätter: So right now, for Definite 2, there are already discussions, like, if we can even go to $150 million for testing, because some tests are not working anymore because of hitting limits. So it makes sense if we at least consider

343
00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:29.329
Toni Wahrstätter: instead of going to, 15 and 60 call data cost going directly to 64.64, I already checked, and it looks like,

344
00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:36.789
Toni Wahrstätter: It's marginally more users that are affected, and more comprehensive analysis to be done, of course.

345
00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:48.129
Toni Wahrstätter: But so far, it looks like the impact would be marginal, while we actually, yeah, get rid of this, max block size topic for a while.

346
00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:57.119
Ben Adams: Would that cause a massive left edge, though? Because the difference…

347
00:48:57.930 --> 00:48:59.549
Ben Adams: You know, if you grow up, of course, sorry.

348
00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:07.840
Ben Adams: Cliff edge. So if you go over by, you know, one byte, and now it's cold data, suddenly your cold data

349
00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:21.560
Toni Wahrstätter: No, no, the mechanism stays the same, as it is with 7623. So you would still have this floor cost, you would just have on one side the floor, the price being calculated by

350
00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:32.720
Toni Wahrstätter: call data with the 416 pricing, plus execution gas, and on the other side of the max formula, you would have the call data, floor pricing.

351
00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.550
Toni Wahrstätter: with the 6464.

352
00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:36.280
Ben Adams: Okay.

353
00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:41.929
Toni Wahrstätter: So it would not cause, like, a big jump, it would still be… Like, a steady increase.

354
00:49:55.710 --> 00:50:00.819
Maria Silva: Thanks for… thanks for raising that, and I think, yeah, that… that seems to make sense, Tony.

355
00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:02.400
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah.

356
00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:16.510
Toni Wahrstätter: I think I will say… I will create a PR for the 6464, and then in, like, 2 weeks, I will put it on the agenda again, and maybe we can already finalize it, because then it will be early enough, definitely.

357
00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:19.330
Maria Silva: Sounds good.

358
00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:27.280
Maria Silva: Anything else people want to discuss?

359
00:50:28.050 --> 00:50:29.339
Maria Silva: Ashuri, wrap up.

360
00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:38.579
Maria Silva: Yeah, sounds good.

361
00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:41.680
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, maybe just a very quick, question.

362
00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:44.060
Ansgar Dietrichs: I think we have…

363
00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:55.989
Ansgar Dietrichs: Remember, I see, you know, someone from OP Labs on the call, and also from L2Beat. I'm just wondering, if, from either side, basically, if there's any comments on…

364
00:50:56.550 --> 00:51:09.619
Ansgar Dietrichs: kind of, obviously, a lot of the L1 repricings might also end up, wanting to be taken over by the L2s, and so is there anything in terms of process as we go through, through these,

365
00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:26.310
Ansgar Dietrichs: through these changes on the L1 that we could do to help make this accessible for L2s? Is this already in a good place? I don't know, just anything in case, just in case either of you two, or anyone else here that maybe is also from the L2 side on the call would have any comment. Just curious.

366
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:27.160
Ansgar Dietrichs: Josh?

367
00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:39.129
Josh | OP Labs: Yeah, I think things are. Yeah, I think at this time, there's not much action to be taken on our end. Obviously, there's a lot of the benchmarking work that's being done is

368
00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:46.470
Josh | OP Labs: I guess still applicable to… to us at OP, which is great.

369
00:51:46.600 --> 00:52:01.989
Josh | OP Labs: I think for us, the only things that we look at, primarily for, like, where divergence may happen, or where our additional risks may arise, is when looking at DA costs and, proof-system implications.

370
00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:04.189
Josh | OP Labs: Since those are really the…

371
00:52:04.410 --> 00:52:09.789
Josh | OP Labs: two major differences between what happens at L1 and what happens on OP stack chains.

372
00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:23.269
Josh | OP Labs: I think one area for collaboration, is to discuss, maybe among the teams that are working on benchmarking at L1, and some of the benchmarking work that we're doing on the OP stack. I would love to

373
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:30.280
Josh | OP Labs: maybe form some tighter collaboration there, since I think there's a lot of… I sense that there's a lot of repeat work that's being done, so…

374
00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:37.409
Josh | OP Labs: I don't know, maybe we, just align on the best place to share these findings, tooling, and just…

375
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:40.900
Josh | OP Labs: Generally, deduplicate a lot of the work that's happening.

376
00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:49.610
Josh | OP Labs: That would be maybe the only ask at this point, but yeah, looking forward to attending these calls in the future, and I think, it's exciting progress all around.

377
00:52:57.670 --> 00:53:08.560
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. That's a useful perspective, thank you. And, I'm not sure if anyone here on the call has anything right now to say in terms of, like, best place to share, kind of, collaborate on benchmarking?

378
00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:27.300
Ansgar Dietrichs: side questions. Otherwise, I think… I know that, this question has come up in the past, so I think we are kind of actively thinking about how to strengthen collaboration with our two stand, so… otherwise, I can also just, for now, note down that OP Labs is also very interested, and so once we have some thoughts, we'll reach out to y'all.

379
00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:40.579
jochem-brouwer: Yeah, maybe just to chime in, we are adding a benchmark test to the EAST testing suite. I'm not sure if OP Labs is aware of this.

380
00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:46.899
jochem-brouwer: But this sounds something that can be directly integrated also in the benchmarks for the OP stack.

381
00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:58.729
Josh | OP Labs: Excellent, thank you. Is this related to the, benchmarker tool that, I just happened to see was recently being developed?

382
00:53:59.590 --> 00:54:14.140
jochem-brouwer: Yes, yeah, exactly. Because it's, like, it's generic EVM opcodes benchmarks, and also an effort to run this on top of state, so also benchmarking the state-related opcodes, so on top of

383
00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:15.260
jochem-brouwer: big state.

384
00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:23.340
Josh | OP Labs: Okay, fantastic. And the EEST benchmark suite, I'm not familiar with the details, can that be run

385
00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:37.139
Josh | OP Labs: by external tooling as well? Like, does… I imagine just… does… do those tests, like, just craft transactions and then can be run by, like, an external orchestration tool? For example, we've been developing some things ourselves that we may want to use for this.

386
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:40.029
Josh | OP Labs: Or does it require the use of the benchmarker tool?

387
00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:52.020
jochem-brouwer: So, the output of these tests, they can be converted to fixtures, so, like, the normal testing format. The only thing is that we are currently working on,

388
00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:56.390
jochem-brouwer: If the fixtures are built on top of state, this is a little bit more difficult.

389
00:54:56.550 --> 00:55:05.389
jochem-brouwer: But I think what we should maybe do is, on ETH R&D, if we could use the EL testing channel, for this.

390
00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:08.080
jochem-brouwer: To align, like, the benchmarking efforts.

391
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:09.250
jochem-brouwer: To get there.

392
00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:12.770
Josh | OP Labs: Okay, yeah, sounds good. Let's take this discussion there. Appreciate it.

393
00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:15.020
jochem-brouwer: Okay, I will open a thread there. Yeah, thanks.

394
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.830
Maria Silva: Perfect.

395
00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:26.010
Maria Silva: Is there any other points, or…

396
00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:27.720
Maria Silva: Questions?

397
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:48.090
Maria Silva: Okay, so, if not, thank you all for attending, and, yeah, this will… we'll have, the next call in two weeks.

398
00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:55.500
Maria Silva: Bye bye.

399
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:56.480
Ansgar Dietrichs: Fantastic.

400
00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:58.580
Toni Wahrstätter: Awesome, thank you. Bye-bye.
