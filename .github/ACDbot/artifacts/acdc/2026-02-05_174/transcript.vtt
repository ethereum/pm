00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.770
Mario Havel: Hey, Pooja.

2
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.509
Mario Havel: What are you doing?

3
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.130
Pooja Ranjan: Mario, good, good.

4
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.130
Pooja Ranjan: So, if you would like, maybe you can start pre-streaming. I hope you have the files.

5
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:28.139
Mario Havel: Yes, I have everything. I think I'm ready now. I have enabled the, YouTube and ECH Twitter, and I have the Starting Soon page here, so I can… I would just hit start streaming, and let's check it, I guess.

6
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.610
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, maybe 5 minutes before the meeting, you can hit it, and we can verify it.

7
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.350
Mario Havel: Okay, so let's give it 5 minutes, and… and we'll…

8
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.990
Pooja Ranjan: Sure.

9
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.930
Mario Havel: this to Dan, yeah.

10
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.950
Mario Havel: Yeah, I think I got it all and did not forget anything. Thanks for joining.

11
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.659
Pooja Ranjan: No risk, yep.

12
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.789
Mario Havel: Okay, I will start the stream now.

13
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.460
Pooja Ranjan: Okay.

14
00:08:53.830 --> 00:09:01.370
Mario Havel: Let's see, connecting… And, sending data and streaming, I guess.

15
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.459
Mario Havel: And, I'm checking the YouTube, but if you keep eye on the Twitter…

16
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:12.300
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, I have opened both on my end. Yes, it seems YouTube is working well now.

17
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.260
Mario Havel: Perfect. Awesome. Yeah.

18
00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:21.040
Pooja Ranjan: And Twitter, I guess, will start after 3 minutes, but since this is working, my guess is that will be 2. But I'll let you know.

19
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.620
Mario Havel: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much, Pooja, awesome.

20
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:25.910
Pooja Ranjan: Thank you for doing it here.

21
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:31.869
Mario Havel: Yeah, of course, yeah, it's pretty straightforward, just like, you know, to be sure, because it's the first time doing it live.

22
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.159
Mario Havel: It's good.

23
00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:38.060
Pooja Ranjan: Many thanks to Josh, he has streamlined this with restreaming, yes.

24
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.329
Mario Havel: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, he did a great job, he explained me everything, and…

25
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.280
Pooja Ranjan: -

26
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.240
Mario Havel: Seemed pretty, pretty well… yeah, cool.

27
00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.390
Pooja Ranjan: Cheer.

28
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.779
Pooja Ranjan: It's on Twitter as well, Mario.

29
00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:15.559
Mario Havel: Awesome. Thank you.

30
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.960
stokes: Hello, everyone.

31
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:26.150
stokes: Let's see… Yeah, GM.

32
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:33.290
stokes: Let's give people another minute or two, and we'll kick things off.

33
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:44.750
stokes: Just a quick mic check, people can hear me right.

34
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.819
Pooja Ranjan: Yes, we can.

35
00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:49.280
stokes: Okay, thank you.

36
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.090
stokes: I have accumulated some issue with the drivers.

37
00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.209
stokes: With my hardware.

38
00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.869
stokes: And it's always a surprise.

39
00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.730
stokes: If the headphones connect correctly or not.

40
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.700
stokes: I guess this is just get something wired.

41
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:09.710
stokes: And then… I won't have that issue.

42
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:16.890
stokes: But yeah, let's wait, like, one more minute, and we will get started.

43
00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:25.520
stokes: Alright.

44
00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:30.440
stokes: Interesting.

45
00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.769
stokes: It looks like a new headliner came in.

46
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.569
stokes: In any case, we can get into it today.

47
00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:47.840
stokes: Let's see, is… Josh here…

48
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.850
Mario Havel: I'm streaming today.

49
00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:56.950
stokes: Oh, great. Okay. Then, yep. We're ready when you are, Mario.

50
00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.540
Mario Havel: Okay, switching to the main screen.

51
00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.949
Mario Havel: And we are alive, I believe.

52
00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:04.990
stokes: Okay, thank you.

53
00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:10.430
stokes: Hey everyone, welcome to ACDC number 174.

54
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:18.309
stokes: Let's see, this is issue 1907 in the PM repo.

55
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.849
stokes: Let me drop a link to the agenda there.

56
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.650
stokes: In the chat.

57
00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:32.750
stokes: And yeah, so today, a few things. There's an interfork update, as we've been calling it.

58
00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:39.180
stokes: Around cell-level deltas, which are useful at the networking layer, and tying to blob scaling.

59
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.370
stokes: I did want to check in on…

60
00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:49.560
stokes: EPBS with Glamsterdam, and to get a sense of, yeah, how the dead notes are going there, and where we think we're at.

61
00:16:50.340 --> 00:17:01.199
stokes: And, yesterday was the deadline for submitting headliner proposals. We now move to the phase of discussing these headliners for Hagota.

62
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:05.510
stokes: And making progress on selecting one. So…

63
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:07.400
stokes: Well, let's go ahead and get into it.

64
00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:22.380
stokes: First up, yeah, I just try to sequence, sequence these in terms of work order, and given that this topic is kind of in between, say, Fusaka and Glamsterdam, we'll get into cell-level telpas.

65
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:29.070
stokes: Marco wanted to give a brief update on that, and yeah, I'll probably just turn it over to him now.

66
00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.600
Marco Munizaga: Right off the bat, oh man.

67
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:39.119
Marco Munizaga: I mean, give me one second to share my screen.

68
00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.260
Marco Munizaga: Okay.

69
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.939
stokes: Yeah, no worries.

70
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:50.219
Marco Munizaga: Well, I don't have, like, too much prepared here, but I just wanted to give folks a…

71
00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:55.439
Marco Munizaga: Fairly lightweight update on, the sellable deltas, and, you know, just kind of…

72
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:59.479
Marco Munizaga: For visibility, if you're not aware of it…

73
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.440
Marco Munizaga: Let me share my screen.

74
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.180
Marco Munizaga: Feel free… Here with questions.

75
00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:19.710
Marco Munizaga: And, yeah, I'll… the right thing… Okay, share… Alright.

76
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:21.419
Marco Munizaga: Can folks see that alright?

77
00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:22.560
stokes: Yep.

78
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.789
Marco Munizaga: Okay, I'll zoom in unless someone says something.

79
00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.560
Marco Munizaga: So, right.

80
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:32.930
Marco Munizaga: Sell all the others, here's some useful links, and I'll share this, markdown later.

81
00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:41.130
Marco Munizaga: But the idea is, instead of pushing full data columns to peers, that we're doing today for, the…

82
00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.770
Marco Munizaga: DA destination phase.

83
00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:59.600
Marco Munizaga: We can instead exchange bitmaps and only exchange the missing cells that appear as missing, and this is better in cases where we have at least some blobs that are present in the mempool, which today, this is all cases.

84
00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:05.440
Marco Munizaga: And it's a backwards compatible optimization. You can enable and disable it with a feature flag.

85
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:11.829
Marco Munizaga: This is just… Use transparently whenever the two peers over Gossip sub support it.

86
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:26.810
Marco Munizaga: And, yeah, to give you a sense of how far along we are on implementation, I asked these folks to just give a quick update on the status.

87
00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:33.610
Marco Munizaga: So, it doesn't have to be big, but, you know, just like a quick update, just randomly start with Daniel.

88
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:46.949
Daniel Knopik: Alright, so from Lighthouse side, we are almost done with implementation. Only, recent change to the specs have not been implemented yet.

89
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:57.010
Daniel Knopik: But otherwise, it's just a bit, you know, general polish left, like some better logging metrics, etc. But otherwise, close to done.

90
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.089
Marco Munizaga: Very cool. Arsh?

91
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.760
ashah: Yeah, hi, sure, so…

92
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:11.300
ashah: Thanks, thanks, Daniel. So on the PRISM side, we are reviewing the PR that,

93
00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:22.620
ashah: marker raised to implement the partial cells, work in PRISM. I think we've been making good progress on the review. Now, there were some missing bits in there.

94
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:35.950
ashah: Around handling, eager push for partial data column headers. That's what we are, working on right now, and we need to incorporate some of the latest COSSIP sub changes around sending request bit masks.

95
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.520
ashah: On top of the parts metadata.

96
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:45.929
ashah: And after that, we plan to do some really solid testing of this end-to-end. But yeah, almost there.

97
00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.570
Marco Munizaga: Thanks, Arsh.

98
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.170
Marco Munizaga: Dustin, are you here? Do you wanna… Favorite word?

99
00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:56.210
Dustin: It's short.

100
00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:05.819
Dustin: Yeah, sure. So… We have, our, our WebP2P implementation is, is in…

101
00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:22.530
Dustin: testing, and so we also have some ongoing effort, sort of ongoing work on the, sort of, the CL side, sort of for brief reference, and Nimbuses are… or for IFT slash Nimbuses are two separate organizations doing the P2P and the Ethereum client.

102
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.939
Dustin: Currently, and so…

103
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:33.279
Dustin: That hasn't been… so we… we are not yet at the point where we can promise a specific shipping time on that, because that has…

104
00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.080
Dustin: God.

105
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:43.319
Dustin: Yeah, it's part of the… it's… the P2P doesn't support it quite yet, but or it's the… the full end-to-end testing on the P2P side is not there yet.

106
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:51.859
Dustin: And, hopefully once… once that's there, we can… Kind of… Move reasonably quickly, but…

107
00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:56.510
Marco Munizaga: Cool.

108
00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.330
Marco Munizaga: Thanks, Dustin.

109
00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.679
Marco Munizaga: Any questions here? Pause for a second, just to give folks…

110
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:08.049
Marco Munizaga: I know this is very, like, brief, so if there's any.

111
00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:11.969
stokes: It sounds like… it sounds like Matt, might have an update for Lodestar as well.

112
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.410
Marco Munizaga: Oh, sorry. Let me open the chat.

113
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.139
Marco Munizaga: Oh, yeah, Matt, sorry.

114
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:28.950
Matthew Keil: Hi, yeah, we also have a tentative implementation, going through some debugging and just cleaning up, but, getting closer as well.

115
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:33.709
Marco Munizaga: Thank you, Matt.

116
00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:40.139
Marco Munizaga: Am I cutting out? I'm sorry. It's a little choppy, but I think we can make it work.

117
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:48.829
Marco Munizaga: So, the next thing that I just want to, like, highlight is we have some… So, just rough…

118
00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.870
Marco Munizaga: thoughts on how we're gonna test this. We have, like, a…

119
00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.739
Marco Munizaga: Blob DevNet, thanks to Barnabas for spinning this up.

120
00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:02.169
Marco Munizaga: and as we finish implementing the consensus specs here, we have some test cases we want to cover.

121
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:11.279
Marco Munizaga: I mentioned this here not as, like, a super exhaustive list, but, like, also to try to get some input into, if anyone here has

122
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:15.330
Marco Munizaga: Ideas that you think are important for this that is not covered.

123
00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:21.370
Marco Munizaga: So, like, you know, basic cases of, like, oh, everyone supports partial messages, or…

124
00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:27.269
Marco Munizaga: This is all private blobs, and there's nothing in the mempool, so we should see similar…

125
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.690
Marco Munizaga: Patterns as, like, the full data columns.

126
00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:49.840
Marco Munizaga: a case of, like, you know, there's always one cell missing, some large portion of… or some large portion of the network does not support partial messages, and we should… we should observe that peers are still well and randomly connected, so we're not… we don't see clustering, we don't see peers, like, automatically prefer,

127
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.979
Marco Munizaga: Peers that support this optimization?

128
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:56.319
Marco Munizaga: And just a couple of other things you can read there.

129
00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:04.079
Marco Munizaga: And then, just… Briefly talking about possible deployment strategies, so…

130
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:08.280
Marco Munizaga: I think what's cool about this optimization is

131
00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:17.940
Marco Munizaga: we can enable it, and we can disable it. So, we'll do a ton of testing in the DevNets and testnets, and this is where I did not finish writing the slide. We can…

132
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:27.879
Marco Munizaga: progressively roll this out to validators we control, and kind of observe how they do over time. And if we ever notice anything weird, we can always just

133
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:34.459
Marco Munizaga: remove that feature flag. And, yeah, this isn't something that requires

134
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:39.560
Marco Munizaga: like, the whole network to adopt at once. We… we can, you know.

135
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.630
Marco Munizaga: Do this as progressively as we feel comfortable with.

136
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.410
Marco Munizaga: That's it, that's all I got. Any questions here?

137
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:54.760
stokes: Thanks, Marco.

138
00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:56.339
stokes: Oh yeah, Barnabas?

139
00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:03.320
Barnabas: Yeah, I would like to raise that, you know, Blob DevNet Zero has been running now for.

140
00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:21.119
Barnabas: two weeks. It's been very stable, luckily. We've been trying to collect some metrics, to still get the lab to catch up. Maybe in two weeks I can give a better update, but, we're gonna be collecting some information about,

141
00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:30.949
Barnabas: they get these three metrics, and we also have a few metrics in Graf Island dashboards, that Marco has put together.

142
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:37.869
Barnabas: They're still a work in progress, but hopefully we're gonna be able to see a lot more details in a couple of weeks.

143
00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:48.410
Barnabas: Ideally, also, all the new metrics should be implemented by all the different SEA clients. If you have any questions regarding those, let us know.

144
00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.989
Marco Munizaga: Thanks, Barnabis. I'll link the PR that talks about which metrics we're adding.

145
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.380
stokes: Okay.

146
00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:09.520
stokes: Yeah, and then I guess, in terms of, yeah, getting this to mainnet,

147
00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:22.299
stokes: So it is really nice that we can do this progressively. And, you know, the idea here is that this can be done in between forks, you know, it is a backwards compatible feature.

148
00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:35.929
stokes: So, in terms of deployment, you know, I think this is something we should try to keep pushing on. I don't think anyone is rushing to get to another BPO, you know, in the immediate term.

149
00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:47.439
stokes: But, as I understand, based on, yeah, the design and initial testing, this is actually, like, a huge bandwidth savings on the network, so I think the sooner we can get it out, the better.

150
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:52.319
stokes: Yeah, so… Just to have on everyone's radar.

151
00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:57.340
stokes: Do any client teams see any issues with, you know, moving forward on this?

152
00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:07.759
stokes: And what I mean concretely is, like, deploying this even before Amsterdam, you know, assuming we get things ready in time.

153
00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:20.049
stokes: Because if not, that would be the proposal to move forward here.

154
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.150
stokes: Even before we think about more BPOs.

155
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:24.590
Marco Munizaga: Correct, yeah.

156
00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:25.870
stokes: Yeah.

157
00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:31.589
Barnabas: Yeah, I think we should draw it out,

158
00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:40.310
Barnabas: As soon as we can, and maybe also, the CIP validators could enable these, so we actually see a few,

159
00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.270
Barnabas: A small portion of the mainnet network,

160
00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:51.040
Barnabas: Having these partial cells enabled on them before we… Make, like, a mass release.

161
00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.000
stokes: Right. Yeah.

162
00:27:54.780 --> 00:28:04.479
stokes: And I think the main risk here, again, because it is backwards compatible, is just, like, some weird issue where nodes would kind of tend to cluster on the network.

163
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:10.609
stokes: And that's, I think, worth calling out, just implement carefully, and I think Marco

164
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:17.270
stokes: can help with any questions there. But yeah, I think there's some notion of peer scoring that might tend to this, correct, Marco?

165
00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:32.479
Marco Munizaga: Correct, yeah. This is kind of like a implementation pitfall, nothing with the protocol, but just a thing to keep in mind when implementing this, that you don't want to have a way for these partial message-capable peers to…

166
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:36.439
Marco Munizaga: Do better in peer scoring than their counterparts.

167
00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:51.290
Marco Munizaga: I'll add one more thing that I forgot to add to the slides, which is we have a working group on this work. If you want to join, just reach out to me, and I'll add you to…

168
00:28:51.680 --> 00:29:00.050
Marco Munizaga: the Telegram group, and we have weekly meetings just about issues that have come up and things we're working on.

169
00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:05.520
Marco Munizaga: you don't have to join the meetings. If you don't want to, there's a…

170
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:10.300
Marco Munizaga: Doc that highlights the output of all the meetings and the current state of

171
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:15.199
Marco Munizaga: the work. So, if you want to see that doc, also feel free to reach out to me.

172
00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:22.110
stokes: Okay, thank you.

173
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:27.620
stokes: Then, next up, we'll turn to Amsterdam.

174
00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:35.389
stokes: So, yeah, for here, I did want to check in briefly, how we feel about DevNet Zero.

175
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:41.120
stokes: Yeah, last time, people were still pretty deep into initial implementations.

176
00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:45.929
stokes: And, yeah. Any, any updates here worth touching on?

177
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:57.419
stokes: I do think in terms of keeping things moving, again, like we said, it'd be nice to have the DevNet Zero live sometime this month, so yeah, that's…

178
00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:03.169
stokes: Something like 1, 2… Possibly 3 weeks from today.

179
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:05.720
stokes: How are people feeling about it?

180
00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:10.710
stokes: Potus and Prism says we're targeting it.

181
00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:16.699
stokes: Okay, so there is a new specs release, Justin, do you want to say a bit about that?

182
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:24.300
Justin Traglia: Sure. I mean, this pretty much just, moves the blob KCG commitments from the

183
00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:37.470
Justin Traglia: Wherever to the, bid. So it's a networking change, or a data structure change, which should simplify data availability checks, and I think it's good to include in DevNet Zero.

184
00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.430
Justin Traglia: That's the main change.

185
00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:43.810
stokes: Got it.

186
00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.729
stokes: So yeah, everyone, please target Alpha 2.

187
00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:55.889
stokes: And… yeah, another update from Lodestar, targeting of the month. So, yeah, I think this should be what we aim for.

188
00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:07.819
stokes: And, you know, until we get there, I think it's gonna be, yeah, tricky to think about other Cluster Dam EIPs, or, yeah, speak more about the timing.

189
00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:10.780
stokes: of Amsterdam, more generally, so…

190
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:22.539
stokes: Keep up the good work, and… yeah, I guess on that note, has anyone run into anything worth surfacing here? Any questions about the spec, or, like, implementation issues that we should discuss?

191
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:23.820
stokes: Lotus?

192
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:41.289
Potuz: Yeah, there was a serious bug that was catched by the Lido researchers. We have one fix, but it's not clear that it's the best way of fixing it. It's regarding deposits. They encourage other clients to look into the current PR. This is in Discord.

193
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:53.200
Potuz: There's, there's another thing that I wanted to highlight, which is… I don't know if other clients, have, have been… have started implementing this.

194
00:31:53.200 --> 00:32:00.470
Potuz: But I, I've been keeping, an annotated version of, of Glamstone, of Gloas.

195
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:15.739
Potuz: And the last document I put out was from 4Choice, because I was myself starting to implement it. And then I realized that most of the complication in 4Choice, at least for Prism, doesn't come from Glowus itself, or it doesn't come from the 4Choice part, it comes from OptimisticSync.

196
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:22.820
stokes: Like, recovering from errors and removing nodes becomes much more complicated, and it has a lot of edge cases.

197
00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:28.090
Potuz: So I would urge people that are starting to work on Forges, if you do this thing of, like.

198
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:36.039
Potuz: keeping a tree in four choice, and then suddenly your engine tells you that a whole branch was invalid, removing it is highly non-trivial.

199
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.139
stokes: Okay, yeah, that's a good flag.

200
00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:54.770
stokes: I was looking at this PR. I guess on the for-choice stuff, like, yeah, we have, at least some infrastructure for four-choice tests. Do you think that that would be helpful for what you were talking about, BOTUS?

201
00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:06.559
Potuz: Yeah, I actually haven't been following what, the status of the new fortress for Gloss is, because, I don't know if Misha is on the call, Terrence was…

202
00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:19.849
Potuz: was collaborating with Misha, with Mikhail Kailini, in trying to use, this new format for the purchase test, but I don't know what the status of those is. But yeah, so we do have

203
00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:32.560
Potuz: test for optimistic sync and removing branches, and even removing, like, jumping branches, in which, if you remove a branch that is invalid, and then your new head is also invalid, that we react correctly.

204
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.550
Potuz: So yes, if we keep those testes, it'll be fine.

205
00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:44.240
stokes: Okay, I'll try to take a look there and, yeah, make sure that we have that going.

206
00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:56.329
stokes: My sense is that most people are starting with, yeah, just sort of the core changes, you know, breaking the block into two, changes with this builder concept, and I think we're gonna probably…

207
00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:03.310
stokes: wait, possibly even until DevNet 1, until there's, like, heavy fork-based testing, but yeah, that means…

208
00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:07.380
stokes: It's time now to get the testing in place so we're ready.

209
00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.210
stokes: When we get to DevNet 1.

210
00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:14.600
stokes: Okay.

211
00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:23.519
stokes: And yeah, I guess any other comments on this deposit bug with the 4897PR?

212
00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:27.889
stokes: Any surprises there?

213
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:36.560
Justin Traglia: Potus mentioned something about it being a potential DOS factor, because of all the signature, verifications, I believe.

214
00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:49.610
Potuz: Oh, no, I think it's very expensive to DOS on this. I mean, you need to pay to set that deposit. It'll cost you at least one ETH, so I don't think it's, I don't think it's so bad. I think cashing it is fine.

215
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.360
Potuz: Also, it shouldn't affect DevNet, because we're not going to have external builders in DevNet Zero, so…

216
00:34:56.699 --> 00:34:58.530
Potuz: It's fine if we put it or not.

217
00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:06.080
Justin Traglia: I should probably just merge the PR, then. It has a few reviews.

218
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:08.730
Justin Traglia: I'll do that after the call.

219
00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.459
stokes: And I can take a look after the call too, Justin.

220
00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:15.920
stokes: Cool.

221
00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:22.710
stokes: End put us, just to clarify, when you say no external builders, the idea with .NET Zero is that everyone's just self-building?

222
00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:28.560
Potuz: Yeah, so what we want to test on DevNet Zero is the separation of the payload and the block.

223
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:39.219
Potuz: We want to have the minimal DevNet that actually shows that we can handle that separation, both broadcast, catching up when we missed a payload, requesting it.

224
00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:49.520
Potuz: Look, everything that is needed just to have a different block, a consensus block from the payload of broadcasting. So that means self-building, but still broadcasting them separately.

225
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:56.120
Potuz: And after we have that, then adding the builder and all of those paths, I believe it becomes much easier.

226
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.199
stokes: Yeah, that… that makes sense to me.

227
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:04.340
stokes: Cool.

228
00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:10.229
stokes: Any other questions or comments on the state of EPVS right now?

229
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:17.200
stokes: Okay.

230
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:30.330
stokes: Then, yeah, I think then we'll keep moving all these threads forward, and yeah, everyone, please do your best to target DeadNet Zero again in the next few weeks.

231
00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:33.339
stokes: It'd be really good to have something here by the end of the month.

232
00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:44.049
stokes: And yeah, if you run into issues with… as you're implementing, yeah, please flag them on Discord, or yeah, you know, an appropriate venue, and yeah, we'll keep things moving along.

233
00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:50.309
stokes: Raul, did you want to say anything on this link here?

234
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:58.809
Raúl Kripalani: Not specifically, just wanted to… to send it over here. Already posted it on underscore just to make it more discoverable.

235
00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:10.170
Raúl Kripalani: But, but yeah, the idea is to, so we started, basically, this tool, takes, real blocks, SSZ encoded, and performs the transformation.

236
00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:29.700
Raúl Kripalani: It does the bifurcation into the beacon block and the execution payload, and then has a breakdown of, all fields, the compression rate, and so on. And the idea is to enhance this with, as I said in chat, with BALS, but also, like, to make it a generally useful tool for us to.

237
00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:43.969
Raúl Kripalani: To perform different kinds of analysis, specifically with regards to deadlines and variable PTC and so on. So it's just, just a tool for us, to, to, to use, to further, like, refine the fork.

238
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:50.410
Raúl Kripalani: So yeah, so just reach out to me if you've got any feedback, or if you'd like to see something specific here.

239
00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:55.530
stokes: Okay, great. Yeah, it looks really nice.

240
00:37:55.980 --> 00:38:02.620
stokes: One quick question, like, it has a delta when we do make the separation into the two parts of the block.

241
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:06.190
stokes: And it shows, you know, the overhead on the wire.

242
00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:14.470
stokes: And most of them are fairly small, but there's a few blocks every so often where it's, like, you know, plus 1 kilobyte, plus 1 kilobyte. Do you have a sense of what's going on there?

243
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:32.870
Raúl Kripalani: Yeah, so I think what's happening here is that the snappy compressor is having a different table for once you separate the block, so basically the efficiency will just vary, so I think that's basically what we're seeing here. Yeah. I see. Interesting.

244
00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:34.830
stokes: Hmm.

245
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:52.940
Raúl Kripalani: And it's just tiny fluctuations, really, so I don't expect that… like, this is kind of, like, something that I personally wanted to have, just wanted to know if we expected to see, like, any major difference on the wire, and I think it's negligible, so it comforts me to see… to know that it's this way.

246
00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:54.899
stokes: Yeah, yeah, definitely.

247
00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:02.570
stokes: Justin had a question in the chat. Why are the raw wire sizes different between food… well, yeah.

248
00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.919
stokes: I think that was what we were just touching on, Justin.

249
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:23.259
Raúl Kripalani: Yeah, exactly. It's just that the compression rate, just varies on the compression table that the snappy… that Snappy is deriving for each payload, because we do… so there is some nuance here, because we don't do block compression, on the wire, we actually do the full…

250
00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:35.070
Raúl Kripalani: Sorry, we don't do the streaming compression, the framing compression for Snappy, we do a block compression, so it just takes the entire payload and compresses it at once. That's, like, some nuance that's relevant here.

251
00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:38.879
Justin Traglia: Okay, I see, makes sense.

252
00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:45.140
stokes: Thanks for sharing.

253
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:54.019
stokes: Okay, then, yeah, if there's nothing else on Glamster Dam…

254
00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:58.200
stokes: The next agenda item is EGOTA.

255
00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:07.969
stokes: So, again, just to play back, the process here. So, we had a deadline yesterday for headliner proposals.

256
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:12.960
stokes: And now we will turn to discussion and finalization.

257
00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.630
stokes: And the way that this works…

258
00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:30.959
stokes: Let me just make sure I have this correct. Yeah, we said we'd have essentially till the end of this month, to do this, and the idea here is, yeah, getting community feedback, discussing them on ACD, C, or E.

259
00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.750
stokes: And then ultimately finalizing the headliner selection.

260
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:43.389
stokes: So… That's the high-level process, and if we look at the headliners that we have,

261
00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:45.560
stokes: You can see them here.

262
00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:50.190
stokes: There's this tag, Hagota, on Ethereum Magicians.

263
00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:54.800
stokes: And we see here that we have a proposal for…

264
00:40:55.090 --> 00:41:01.169
stokes: I'm just gonna call out the CL ones. We have one for Fossil, that we all know very well at this point.

265
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:09.299
stokes: I believe the next few are eel only. There's 2 new ones since I looked yesterday.

266
00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:15.070
stokes: One is for a Lucid encrypted mempool, but I think that's an EL headliner.

267
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:19.030
stokes: And then one here for partial reconstruction and 2D PROS.

268
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:28.870
stokes: So, yeah, I think in terms of moving forward then, So I Spoke did want to, say something about Fossil.

269
00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:34.169
stokes: So, yeah, I think I'll go ahead and turn that over to you, and then we will…

270
00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:35.279
stokes: Go from there.

271
00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:51.600
soispoke: Yeah, thanks. Yeah, I'll keep it very, very brief, because we all know Fossil by now, but I wanted to basically just make it official that we propose Fossil as a Seattle headliner candidate for Hagota.

272
00:41:51.970 --> 00:42:02.529
soispoke: Yeah, maybe I won't go back into what it brings, but just briefly, it, you know, significantly improves transaction inclusion guarantees.

273
00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:15.340
soispoke: And it does this by enabling the multiple validators to build inclusion lists and participate in block building. Primary benefit is clearly censorship resistance,

274
00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:26.190
soispoke: And again, transaction inclusion guarantees, and it benefits basically everyone that's transacting on-chain, so from everyday users to L2s to institutions.

275
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:29.940
soispoke: It does also benefit validators, you know, because…

276
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:43.659
soispoke: it, like, first of all, is actually a step towards enabling validators to contribute to preserving censorship resistance without having to be a local builder and sort of, like, sacrificed MEV rewards.

277
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:48.060
soispoke: And at this point, I think it's also kind of clear that

278
00:42:48.090 --> 00:43:06.710
soispoke: ProSol is, like, a crucial component in the future architecture of the protocol, given the sort of, like, scaling and ZKVM directions we are headed towards. And lastly, in terms of technical readiness, you know, the design and specs have been reviewed and improved on for, like, 2 years now.

279
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:17.799
soispoke: I think today we have 8 out of 11 clients that have implemented For Soul prototypes. Of course, at, like, various stages, but, it's still quite a lot.

280
00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:28.589
soispoke: And process-wise, it is, currently CFI'd for Hagota. I think it's the only one because of the…

281
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:47.869
soispoke: sort of, like, governance phase we had, for Glamstadam at the time. And, you know, if it ends up being SFI, the immediate plan will be to rebase on top of EPBS, and Gloss more generally, since I think the specs have been frozen.

282
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:50.530
soispoke: And yeah, that's where we are right now.

283
00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:54.820
stokes: Thanks.

284
00:43:57.190 --> 00:44:05.039
stokes: So, yeah, in terms of moving forward, I do see Leo here on the call.

285
00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:12.289
stokes: Would you like to say something about your post to propose partial reconstruction in 2D PyRDOS?

286
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:21.819
Leo: Hello? Can you hear me?

287
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:22.720
stokes: Yep.

288
00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:36.349
Leo: Yep. Yes, I would like to say a couple of words. So the idea here is, to do, some preliminary steps towards, full two-dimensional yardas.

289
00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:42.399
Leo: I want to make clear that I'm not looking at a full two-dimensional

290
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:51.570
Leo: and complete vertical extension, I think we can start, with smaller steps, like just extend probably just a couple of rows.

291
00:44:51.830 --> 00:45:05.299
Leo: So that the overhead in terms of, data to custody and bandwidth is not, too large. But I think, that will allow us to move forward into the two-dimensional implementation.

292
00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:13.389
Leo: And also, I would like to propose to do the vertical extension outside the four-choice critical path.

293
00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:19.080
Leo: So that we, you know, we… Have less risks into…

294
00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:23.879
Leo: Into this implementation of 2D mission or PLAS.

295
00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:37.930
Leo: So, yeah, take a look at the… at the proposal, but I think, in terms of moving forward for scalability, I think this is quite important, and this will allow us not only, you know, we already have kind of…

296
00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:49.249
Leo: row reconstruction with, partial messaging and cell… I mean, cell level messaging and partial reconstruction, but I think it's important to have vertical reconstruction as well.

297
00:45:49.320 --> 00:46:08.800
Leo: And, I think the… the way I suggested in the proposal is a possible way that is not very intrusive, is not very critical, and allow us to move forward towards collaboratively. So please take a look, and if you have any questions, remarks, please leave it in the post, or contact me directly.

298
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.810
Leo: Thanks.

299
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:14.270
stokes: Better? Thank you.

300
00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:28.069
stokes: And… yeah. So… I had expected there to only be one headliner proposal, and I would have thought then today we could have optimistically made that selection.

301
00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:41.460
stokes: But yeah, given that there's the second one here, I think it probably makes sense to give people some time to think about this, and then make the call on the next ACDC.

302
00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:47.829
stokes: That being said, I think we should go ahead and discuss today, where people are at.

303
00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:56.300
stokes: Following up from a comment that Ankara had in the chat, I do think there's broad consensus, with prioritizing CR for Hagota.

304
00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:04.179
stokes: Yeah, so… How do clients feel about this? Or, yeah, generally anyone else on the call.

305
00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:13.429
stokes: I do think, given… how we have been having the conversation around thinking about scoping for Hagota.

306
00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:20.860
stokes: it seemed like Fossil would be the headliner we would pick, but yeah, I'd like to open the floor for any discussion.

307
00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:28.870
stokes: On Sigar?

308
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:33.660
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, I just wanted to say from… from my side, because…

309
00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:39.910
Ansgar Dietrichs: I mean, I'm both personally in favor of prioritizing censorship resistance, and I think fossil…

310
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:47.679
Ansgar Dietrichs: to me, looks like it's the right approach. I just wanted to basically say, like, in case we might even potentially make the decision today, or at least in two weeks.

311
00:47:47.840 --> 00:48:06.129
Ansgar Dietrichs: Given that a headliner choice is quite the committal, decision, and I feel like there has been so much broad support around Fossil that I think there's a bit of a risk that we just, you know, blindly kind of wave it through without one more kind of rigorous check of, like, are we, like, really 100% certain this is the right approach? Again, my intuition is the answer will be yes.

312
00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:09.619
Ansgar Dietrichs: But I was just wondering, kind of, how many people here have already, like.

313
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:29.069
Ansgar Dietrichs: thought about this in enough depth that they have, like, very high confidence, versus is there something we should do, say, between now and two weeks from now, just to get to this 100% level of confidence? Again, might well be that people are already there, I just… I personally am not close enough to Fossil that I'm necessarily yet fully there, but, yeah, just wanted to flag this.

314
00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:37.540
stokes: Yeah, my senses… people are there, already. But, yeah, Matt.

315
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:43.629
Matthew Keil: We are strongly in favor of it, and support it, for H-star.

316
00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.260
stokes: Okay, great.

317
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:51.340
stokes: Any other client teams, want to speak to Fossil right now?

318
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:06.789
stokes: I will echo then that people are strongly in support, as we were discussing this in Glamsterdam, so…

319
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:10.119
stokes: I expect that not to change, even if,

320
00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:16.710
stokes: People aren't chiming in now? Okay. We got another comment from Teku, at least from Enrico on the Teku team, also.

321
00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:31.470
stokes: Yeah. So that being said, we should follow the process, and given that, we kind of have this very recent other proposal with, the 2D reconstruction.

322
00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:45.469
stokes: I think it does make sense, to take one more call, give people another two weeks to think about this a bit more. From there, also, yeah, in terms of ongoing concerns, just, yeah, taking a final pass and just, yeah, being…

323
00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:47.550
stokes: Confident in our selection.

324
00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:49.740
stokes: But yeah.

325
00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:59.549
stokes: Because of that, then, I think that we should expect to make the headliner selection for Hagota on the CL side on next ACDC.

326
00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.040
stokes: And then we can go from there.

327
00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:14.269
stokes: I guess in terms of, Leo's proposal, is there anything, you know, like, should people just reach out to you directly, or do you want to…

328
00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:17.509
stokes: Point people to a particular place if they have questions in the meantime.

329
00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:27.089
Leo: Yes, feel free to, answer in the post, or reach out to me directly, or if anybody has comments right now.

330
00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:30.560
Leo: Every question. Questions.

331
00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:33.730
stokes: Okay.

332
00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:38.470
stokes: Any questions or comments for Leo at the moment?

333
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:47.510
stokes: Okay.

334
00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:55.149
stokes: Let's see, let me just make another pass on the agenda, so… yeah, I think that was it for today.

335
00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:59.880
stokes: Again, I think people are pretty busy with, APBS.net Zero.

336
00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:05.889
stokes: And… yeah. Otherwise, let's go ahead and be prepared.

337
00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:15.220
stokes: To make the headliner selection on the CL side. Again, if we want to take some time on the next call, just to have, you know, more discussion.

338
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:21.310
stokes: We'll do that, but again, we're in a place to make that call two weeks from today, so let's do that.

339
00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:27.190
stokes: And… otherwise… Yeah, anything else?

340
00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:47.269
stokes: Okay, if not then, yeah, solid-level deltas to have, on… on the radar.

341
00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:51.080
stokes: Of course, everyone's very heads down with EPBS step node 0.

342
00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:56.629
stokes: Please, yeah, reach out if you run into any issues there, just so we can keep things moving.

343
00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:03.189
stokes: And… yeah, then we'll make the call for the Hagota headliner on next ACDC.

344
00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:06.290
stokes: And that should be it for today.

345
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:08.639
stokes: Thanks, everyone. I'll see you next time.

346
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.250
Potuz: Bye-bye.

347
00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:13.920
Justin Traglia: Bye, everyone.

348
00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:15.410
Ansgar Dietrichs: Everyone.
