AFAIK the max bar width is the max of what’s displayed in the view (so it’s already relative). Are you seeing something different?

is ratio sign hardcoded to be - ?

Seems the first two should be positive, not negative
00:43:54	Ansgar Dietrichs:	I think we have broad consensus on prioritizing CR in H*.

I am not super deep in the weeds on the specifics of the FOCIL mechanism - how much consensus is there around this specifically being the right approach? Is this something that needs more discussion? If so, would we do that before or after selecting it as headliner?
00:44:21	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "I think we have broa..."

I think I remember some skepticism by @Toni Wahrstätter for example?

yes I just want to confirm we actually think it’s the right thing to do. My assumption is that the answer is yes, but important to be certain about this.
00:45:52	Julian Ma:	Replying to "I think we have broa..."

Do you mean whether FOCIL as a whole is the right specific approach or whether some of the specifics of FOCIL should be changed like exact enforcement rules of the IL and size etc
00:46:14	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "I think we have broa..."

@Julian Ma FOCIL as a whole - adjustments can always be made post headliner selection

00:46:21	soispoke:	@Ansgar Dietrichs I don’t want to speak for Toni but I’d say some critics were mostly around prioritizing CR/FOCIL for H* 

And maybe the conditional/unconditional property (but it’s more of a FOCIL parameter)

00:47:23	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "[Full message cannot be displayed on this version]" 

 Yeah agree, it feels like the majority is for focil and this is what we should then go for as a headliner 👍🏼
00:47:24	donnoh | L2BEAT:	Replying to "I think we have broa…"
from my convos with optimistic rollups in the context of reducing the challenge period, focil is not seen as a blocker but rather other things mainly related to networking or unknown bugs (concerns mainly coming from offchain labs). i’d love to have a better economic model to understand benefits in terms of economic advantage, mainly in terms of additional cost to attacker to bribe to miss slots (or the IL committee). as a comparison, 6s slots increase the attacker cost by 2x, not sure if FOCIL is more or less
00:48:12	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "[Full message cannot be displayed on this version]" 

 Agree with ansgar here though
00:48:36	Julian Ma:	Replying to "I think we have broa..."

I’m not aware of any other mechanism. The big property FOCIL does not give is CR for MEV txs.

The proposed mechanisms for that - multiple concurrent proposers, explored mostly for e.g. Solana - seem to be converging on being very very similar to the FOCIL architecture
00:48:37	soispoke:	https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/hegota-headliner-proposal-focil-eip-7805/27604

In the proposal btw we mentioned the tradeoffs (and the critics) explicitly
00:48:39	DA | Flashbots:	Replying to "I think we have broa..."

There’s quite of bit of consensus in MEV research that FOCIL is a pretty weak design. Worse than unconditional ILs and much worse than some other less fleshed out designs. 

But the impact on builders is very little. So we’re not blocking.
00:48:40	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "[Full message cannot be displayed on this version]" 

 Should now also be considered in light of AA or encrypted mempools as potential EL headliners
00:49:03	Julian Ma:	Replying to "I think we have broa..."

I meant the main bar, the ones below are not normalized, so they are good. But every time the main bar is refreshed  we need to look at the number to understand. Is a detail, but I thought it could help.
00:51:30	Francesco:	Replying to "I think we have broa..."

Imho we should very much consider having the design be unconditional for now, everything else can hopefully be built in the future from the foundation of multiple contributions to the building process

00:52:13	Julian Ma:	Replying to "I think we have broa..."

From what I understand to be the current main proposal, it’s based on this minus the erasure coding part https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1772 

It’s basically FOCIL infra + some small rule changes + potentially encryption

That is to say, if we do FOCIL, we could extend it into MCP. FOCIL is a necessary step for it
