00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.380
Gaudenzio Nethermind: Go then!

2
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.460
Antonio Sanso: Hello, hello. I guarantee you.

3
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.430
Antonio Sanso: Can you hear me?

4
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.279
Gaudenzio Nethermind: Yes, I can hear you very well.

5
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.400
Antonio Sanso: I think the call is recorded, and not sure it's gonna be on YouTube yet.

6
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.370
Gaudenzio Nethermind: No worries.

7
00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:05.489
Antonio Sanso: It's still literally, I was just, trying to check. Actually, do you mind if we do a check with you about the presentation? Let's see…

8
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.999
Antonio Sanso: Cause I have something to present, and… We'll check, please.

9
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.519
Antonio Sanso: Okay, let's see… screens, documents, advanced, documents, no.

10
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.760
Antonio Sanso: So let's try it.

11
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.810
Antonio Sanso: This clip.

12
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.110
Antonio Sanso: Okay.

13
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.440
Antonio Sanso: Metalized crypto.

14
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.280
Antonio Sanso: Okay.

15
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.330
Antonio Sanso: So what do you see nowadays?

16
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.100
Gaudenzio Nethermind: Agenda.

17
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.689
Antonio Sanso: See my… okay, but we'll… you will see, like, the slides… move.

18
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.920
Antonio Sanso: Yes, I see the slide, but only… yeah, it's… Presenter mode, or…

19
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.519
Gaudenzio Nethermind: Yes, presentation mode. Full screen to me.

20
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.360
Antonio Sanso: Full screen, okay, perfect.

21
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.810
Antonio Sanso: Thanks a lot for double checking, it just… That, yes, okay.

22
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.520
Antonio Sanso: Okay, stop sharing.

23
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.519
Gaudenzio Nethermind: Great. I'm gonna grab a coffee. Catch you later, Antonio.

24
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.490
Antonio Sanso: Sure, sure, we're still at 5 minutes, thanks a lot for helping me.

25
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.430
Gaudenzio Nethermind: Of course, good luck, mon ami, goodbye.

26
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.459
Antonio Sanso: Thank you, thank you.

27
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.960
Antonio Sanso: Hello, everyone. It's, 15…

28
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:52.659
Antonio Sanso: UTC… I guess we'll give a few minutes if someone else is joining a bit late. Let's give them a couple of minutes.

29
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.140
Antonio Sanso: And.

30
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:55.810
Stefa: Hello, everybody.

31
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.250
Antonio Sanso: Hey, hey.

32
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:58.220
matteo vicari: Hi.

33
00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.280
Antonio Sanso: smooth.

34
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.790
Antonio Sanso: Hey, hi, Mattel. The agenda is,

35
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.940
Antonio Sanso: That's okay. The agenda is on the… on the GitHub issue.

36
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:16.830
Antonio Sanso: But, yeah. I will start with a quick presentation in a couple of minutes to set the stage. Many of you might know already what I'm saying there.

37
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.259
Antonio Sanso: And, but yeah, we quickly set the stage, and then we'll have some more,

38
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.920
Antonio Sanso: Technical, a more in-depth presentation, and again, everything's in the agenda.

39
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.289
Antonio Sanso: We'll start in a couple of minutes, and yeah.

40
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:31.650
Antonio Sanso: Let's see…

41
00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:04.729
Antonio Sanso: For people who are joining now, we are just waiting a couple of minutes to give the chance for people to join. It's the first call, so some things might be a bit rusty.

42
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:08.939
Antonio Sanso: But, yeah, I'm sure… It's gonna be fine.

43
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:10.880
Renaud-ZKNOX: Hi, everyone.

44
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:18.790
Antonio Sanso: Hey, I see already some of the presenters joining. I see Renault, I see Stefano, I see Simon.

45
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:24.090
Antonio Sanso: So, will be some people presenting after me, so, looking forward.

46
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.219
Antonio Sanso: And one more minute, and we start.

47
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.190
Antonio Sanso: Just double checking, are you guys seeing my… my…

48
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:57.760
Antonio Sanso: slide? Like, okay, cool. Let's start.

49
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:07.809
Antonio Sanso: So, someone thinks on this presentation might be obvious from the beginning, but again, the first call of the post-quantum transaction signature is the kickoff call, so just setting the stage quickly.

50
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.710
Antonio Sanso: And, yeah.

51
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:15.629
Antonio Sanso: Things might sound, like, already known, but, better like this.

52
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:16.860
Antonio Sanso: them.

53
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:24.579
Antonio Sanso: Now, let me probably, again, share… Alright, let's do it. So…

54
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:32.240
Antonio Sanso: February the 4th, and let me try at least to get rid of the Presenter, I'll put another…

55
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.300
Antonio Sanso: Screen, okay.

56
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:39.270
Antonio Sanso: So, breakout room, kickoff call, and, yeah.

57
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:48.430
Antonio Sanso: So, I've done this presentation a bit bigger in the past, but I cut some of the parts here. But again, like, once at the stage, and

58
00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:58.309
Antonio Sanso: I always like to break Ethereum in four micro components. There's the execution layer, the consensus, the data availability sampling layer, and the status theorem.

59
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:02.740
Antonio Sanso: That before had the name of Burkeleton trees is not anymore the case.

60
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:15.590
Antonio Sanso: But yeah, so what these things have in common, well, the execution layer, of course, like, to, to have a signature on a transaction signature, you have BCDSA. For consensus, we use BLS signatures.

61
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:26.479
Antonio Sanso: For data sampling, we use KCG commitment, and for standard Ethereum, we used to have this solution based on Peders and Commitment, and basically, like, what they have in common, that all they use elliptical.

62
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:32.150
Antonio Sanso: In particular, for ACDSA, we have this SECP156K1,

63
00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:51.659
Antonio Sanso: for consensus and KC Commitment BLS, and, for Vertical 3, we used to have this proposal that used Bandersnatch. And, well, we all know that, with, there's this, algorithm, by Shor, 1994, that breaks completely, this, initially was, was designed to, to break

64
00:10:51.660 --> 00:11:03.190
Antonio Sanso: factorization of a big component number, and, yeah, and then it was adapted to break as well this could log on final field and elliptic curve, so we need to start from scratch.

65
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:15.249
Antonio Sanso: So the first things that, that, on this topic was actually introduced by, by, by Vitalik, where, where he actually, showed what it is, mine to do.

66
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:24.409
Antonio Sanso: if some quantum emergency happens, we'll see a presentation from Stefano actually going deeper in that, on this proof of sets later on.

67
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:37.320
Antonio Sanso: And, in this post, actually, we're discussing this, proof of seed that it can be post-quantum, and the fact that, actually, the atrium address, if you, if you never spend any, any, any ether, you're kind of…

68
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:54.479
Antonio Sanso: help save, because you are not exposing your public key, because the address is the Chetri or Kedjak, actually, Kedjak, no, Chetri, of, of, the public, of the public address, of the public key that, that is not exposed directly.

69
00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:08.959
Antonio Sanso: So, again, we did some, some new mathematics that is resistant to quantum cryptography, so to quantum computers, and we basically have, like, this, like, 5-6 macro areas. There's hash-based cryptography.

70
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:16.929
Antonio Sanso: There's a lattice-based cryptography, there's code-based cryptography, multivariate, and a supersingle elliptical resogenic cryptography.

71
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:21.059
Antonio Sanso: And, yeah, we have some algorithm here. We need to choose,

72
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.489
Antonio Sanso: Some that is actually good for us.

73
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:49.319
Antonio Sanso: Now, the message that, that I want to pass here is, like, it really takes time. If we see what happens in the Web 2, well, there was this announcement and a call for proposal by NIST in 2016, then there was this proposal submission that started in 2017. Many got immediately broken, even some the nights of the… when the proposal submission happened.

74
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:55.429
Antonio Sanso: But then, 2018-19, there was the first round of evaluation, where some algorithms were cut.

75
00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:15.620
Antonio Sanso: 2019-20, the second round, and the candidates were standardized, so the selection of the candidate to standardize was in 2022, and the implementation started since 2017 is still going on, so really, it takes time. Which one are the winners? Well, for signatures, there are three, basically, winners.

76
00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.869
Antonio Sanso: Two lattice, one hash-based, so the lithium…

77
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:25.070
Antonio Sanso: Falcon Lattice-based, Sphinx hash-based, and for King Capsillation kyber. Well…

78
00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:31.929
Antonio Sanso: We are… at the moment, we… for these calls, we are only discussing about signatures, so these are…

79
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:37.479
Antonio Sanso: Probably some that we're gonna see, because they're standard, so we're not reinventing the wheel.

80
00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:46.379
Antonio Sanso: And, want to highlight as well that, at the EF, at least we have started to think about post-quantum since long.

81
00:13:46.380 --> 00:14:02.179
Antonio Sanso: So already had the… there's this, Justin Drake talk in 2019, where it was, depicting how Ethereum 3, could look with quantum security. But then we had a series of paper on, synchronized mold signatures using lattice, or…

82
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:08.860
Antonio Sanso: a single secret leader election and so on, that went… the cryptograph team has been working on this.

83
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:10.679
Antonio Sanso: Papers or calls.

84
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.090
Antonio Sanso: During the years.

85
00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:30.340
Antonio Sanso: Well, then, like, in 2024, we have seen a bit of, quantum accelerations. There are the… you probably remember, there's been this article, pointing in, the research from Google, from Microsoft, and, yeah, so…

86
00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:44.970
Antonio Sanso: we really need to actually… we've seen two things. The quantum computing is accelerating, it takes time to select algorithm and deploy, so we really need to do something, and

87
00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:55.070
Antonio Sanso: Yeah, this is probably, you guys seen as well, this, this, tweet by, by Justin, that, actually, shows that the Twin Foundation,

88
00:14:55.270 --> 00:15:03.480
Antonio Sanso: long-term strategy for, for quantum. So,

89
00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:10.360
Antonio Sanso: These are, again, the four components, execution, consensus, data availability, and status.

90
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:18.220
Antonio Sanso: This breakout room is only about execution, so if you're interested about other things, it will be other efforts.

91
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:23.730
Antonio Sanso: On these calls, we mainly focus on post-quantum transaction signatures, so execution layer.

92
00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:38.089
Antonio Sanso: And that's basically the introduction from my side. The agenda for today, after me, we have Reno and Simon that are showing a couple of EIPs that have already been done in the last year.

93
00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:56.769
Antonio Sanso: Then we have Nico showing some new account abstractions that looks to be a really strong pillar for post-quantum transaction signatures on Ethereum. Then we have Fabrizio or Stefan, I think it's Stefan, into presenting zero-knowledge proof of seeds.

94
00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:06.499
Antonio Sanso: And, finally, we have Dano presenting Cryptographic agility, and this will have time to have some discussion, some minutes of room after all this presentation.

95
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.010
Antonio Sanso: And that's basically… From my side.

96
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:19.099
Antonio Sanso: So, I will happily give the word to Reynold Simon. You tell me… Who of the two?

97
00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.989
Antonio Sanso: So is your name, I'll make you presenter, so…

98
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:22.729
Renaud-ZKNOX: Yeah, I will.

99
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:23.650
Antonio Sanso: here.

100
00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.900
Renaud-ZKNOX: I will share my screen. Can you see it?

101
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.229
Antonio Sanso: Sure. Actually, yes.

102
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.419
Simon - ZKNOX: Great. Can you also hear me, or…

103
00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:33.210
Antonio Sanso: Yeah, yeah.

104
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:33.860
Simon - ZKNOX: Okay, cool.

105
00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:47.000
Renaud-ZKNOX: Yeah, great. So, thanks, Antonio, for launching this bracket room, and for having us. We are glad this initiative exists, and I think it's really needed.

106
00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.659
Renaud-ZKNOX: So at Zkinox, we've been working on Post Contem,

107
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:55.930
Renaud-ZKNOX: Cryptography for blockchain, for the past, for the past 2 years.

108
00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.380
Renaud-ZKNOX: closed with, with Antonio and, and the EF.

109
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:09.060
Renaud-ZKNOX: implementing, emulation of the two EIPs that, Simon, will introduce. So basically, we, we've wrote,

110
00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:19.300
Renaud-ZKNOX: EIP8051, which is MLDSA, it's standardized by NIST, and EIP8052. It's FNDSA, it's Falcon precompiled.

111
00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:31.349
Renaud-ZKNOX: So everything is, working, it's deployed, we employed, we integrated it into an e-breed and agile, verifier, so it's a 4337, acquence.

112
00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:37.790
Renaud-ZKNOX: Which can be tuned using K1, R1, MLDSA, or FMDSA. It's,

113
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:55.850
Renaud-ZKNOX: Yeah, so it's, it's deployed, we have, implemented the signers, so basically MLDSA work on ledger hardware signers. We have only, hot wallet, signer for Falcon, because of constraints, and Simon will talk about this.

114
00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:04.820
Renaud-ZKNOX: And we also, we also specified how to derive, derive key with, PQ,

115
00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:11.050
Renaud-ZKNOX: PQ39, so… This is a full stack,

116
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:27.990
Renaud-ZKNOX: So… so it's… it's working, it's working today. Looking at the cost that we have, so Gui is really cheap right now, so even in… in L1, it's, it can be used to protect high-value assets. For instance, we… we implemented for the demo.

117
00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:41.459
Renaud-ZKNOX: yield into IvePool. So, we have, like, with the cost we have today, it's, like, $2 for a single transaction, so it's totally, doable, over L2.

118
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.209
Renaud-ZKNOX: And even for L1, for high-value assets, it's possible, so…

119
00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.969
Renaud-ZKNOX: Even without, without pre-compile.

120
00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:52.239
Renaud-ZKNOX: So why do we need precompiles? We need precompiled because,

121
00:18:52.640 --> 00:19:02.910
Renaud-ZKNOX: If we want it to be comparable with, and have some sub-dollar, some dollar cost, yeah, we will need to switch to precompiles, and…

122
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:10.669
Renaud-ZKNOX: Simon will detail, the… The gas cost and the complexity of the precompiles.

123
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:13.230
Renaud-ZKNOX: Simon?

124
00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.450
Renaud-ZKNOX: Simon?

125
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:25.670
Antonio Sanso: Renault, quickly, like, there is some question on the chat. There's, like…

126
00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:26.409
Simon - ZKNOX: Can you hear me.

127
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:33.219
Antonio Sanso: Yeah, we hear you. Quickly, like, I read this… I don't know if you see, Renault, the question on the chat.

128
00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.040
Renaud-ZKNOX: I will…

129
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:41.720
Antonio Sanso: Good to meet you It's about the… what are the key sites? Okay, perfect, perfect, Simon.

130
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.290
Simon - ZKNOX: I'm gonna talk about this now, yes.

131
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:43.900
Antonio Sanso: Perfect.

132
00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:56.929
Simon - ZKNOX: So, just to give a quick summary of the different options of, signatures, so as Antonio said, there is basically 3 winners of the NIST standardization, Delicium, Falcon, and Sphinx.

133
00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:02.009
Simon - ZKNOX: The two first are based on lattice, and the third one is based on hash function.

134
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:22.320
Simon - ZKNOX: And, the big issue with the third one is that it produces large signatures, and it's a problem in the context of Ethereum, because we want a small footprint on chain. So we decided to look at Delithium and Falcon, the two first ones.

135
00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:28.829
Simon - ZKNOX: And so here you can see, the answer of the equation, the different,

136
00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:38.450
Simon - ZKNOX: public key and signature size, so if you just look at the first two or three lines, you see that Falcon seems to be much better in terms of size.

137
00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:47.759
Simon - ZKNOX: Smaller signature, smaller public key. Also, in terms of gas costs, so we did the implementation of the verifier in SolidZ.

138
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:51.150
Simon - ZKNOX: So that, you can…

139
00:20:51.290 --> 00:21:04.620
Simon - ZKNOX: we can estimate the cost in terms of gas. So, $4 million for Falcon, and 13 million for Delithium, which is much larger than what we have with ECDSA, because it's only a few thousand of gas in…

140
00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.690
Simon - ZKNOX: Using ECDSA.

141
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:13.840
Simon - ZKNOX: If we would have a precompile, we… it would reduce drastically the cost, because we would get something

142
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:21.000
Simon - ZKNOX: more or less similar to ECDSA for Falcon, and slightly higher for MLDSA, for the lithium.

143
00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:32.330
Simon - ZKNOX: So this is in terms of comparison of size and efficiency, but then there are other aspects that are also important. For example.

144
00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:37.760
Simon - ZKNOX: Delithium has been standardized by the NIST with FIPS 204.

145
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:45.040
Simon - ZKNOX: And for Falcon, it's still in the process, and it takes a lot of time, so we don't have a standard yet.

146
00:21:46.180 --> 00:22:00.329
Simon - ZKNOX: In terms of implementation, it's quite tricky to implement Delithium… to implement Falcon, sorry. Delicium is much easier, and that's why we did an implementation even in hardware, while for…

147
00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:12.580
Simon - ZKNOX: For Falcon, we didn't investigate the hardware implementation, also because it uses a lot of RAM, so we focused on delytium in terms of hardware.

148
00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:21.760
Simon - ZKNOX: Glyithium has been integrated into different, industrial projects. It has been…

149
00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:30.560
Simon - ZKNOX: done in Paskey, also in Apple. It's in the process, but it's, seems to be more…

150
00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:41.760
Simon - ZKNOX: there are more products integrating DLTM than Falcon. And finally, in terms of zero-knowledge proof, it seems to be easier to…

151
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:54.510
Simon - ZKNOX: modify delithium to get something ZK-friendly than for Falcon, where the field of definition is very important for the parameterization of the scheme.

152
00:22:55.610 --> 00:23:03.180
Simon - ZKNOX: So this is for… just for comparing Falcon and Delicium. And now if I need to go into detail on the EIPs.

153
00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:13.839
Simon - ZKNOX: So, the first TIP for Delithium, which is MLDSA, actually, is AT51,

154
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:27.969
Simon - ZKNOX: We provide… we decided to propose two precompiles, one for the NIST-compliant version of Delithium, MLDSA, that uses a shake as a hash function.

155
00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:37.270
Simon - ZKNOX: And we decided to propose also a second precompile using… which is exactly the same, but replacing this, shake, but by another hash function.

156
00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:53.949
Simon - ZKNOX: Because, KShack is available on… in the precompile, so it, reduces the gas cost. So using this, change of hash function, we can reach till 8 million gas costs.

157
00:23:55.420 --> 00:24:07.750
Simon - ZKNOX: We provide some test vector, and we integrated this into a hybrid account, where you can create an account, sign a transaction, using both ECDSA and MLDSA.

158
00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:13.290
Simon - ZKNOX: So you'll hear about this later with Renault, that will show you how it works.

159
00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:26.929
Simon - ZKNOX: So this is for the first EIP that we propose, and the second EIP is AT52, so the next one. And here we propose something slightly different, where

160
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:37.230
Simon - ZKNOX: we propose two precompiles, one for the polynomial challenge that is necessary for Falcon, and one for the core algorithm of the verification.

161
00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:46.690
Simon - ZKNOX: So… In Falcon, you have really a separation between the hash and the core verification, which enables you to…

162
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:54.929
Simon - ZKNOX: to… to instantiate Falcon using another hash function without changing the core verification.

163
00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.219
Simon - ZKNOX: So, using these two schemes.

164
00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:06.519
Simon - ZKNOX: you can get till 1.6 million GAS if you use a catch-a-cash function in the verification.

165
00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:15.910
Simon - ZKNOX: And, we also provided some… some test vectors, generated using the NIST reference implementation.

166
00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:28.390
Simon - ZKNOX: And we are still integrating this into a 4337 account, so that you can choose if you want to use Delithium or Falcon for your hybrid account.

167
00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:33.809
Simon - ZKNOX: Yeah, that's it, for me.

168
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.299
Simon - ZKNOX: I think, Renault, you can continue.

169
00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:53.739
Renaud-ZKNOX: Yeah, so, last slide, is about a demo. So, we just dropped the link, to the app, so everyone can launch, launch it. So, basically, while Simon was speaking, I was, staking in Jave.

170
00:25:53.880 --> 00:26:02.300
Renaud-ZKNOX: So, I stack 0.1 Aave here, the user op ran well, it's here, so let's…

171
00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:10.099
Renaud-ZKNOX: Let's have a look on EterScan, but if you scan this, we shall be able to see at this user up.

172
00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:16.669
Renaud-ZKNOX: Of course… Okay, I'm not on Sepoliard.

173
00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.610
Renaud-ZKNOX: Simple later scan.

174
00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:34.500
Renaud-ZKNOX: So, basically, what this means? This means that, we don't have to change the protocol, only the front has to integrate the 43, 37 actions. So, basically, for execution layer.

175
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:47.050
Renaud-ZKNOX: problem is solved, except starting deploying the account, we are still relying on dumb bundlers and EOS, and I guess that's, next evolution of how we'll, we'll solve this.

176
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:52.489
Renaud-ZKNOX: And, yeah, so here is… here is the transaction.

177
00:26:53.740 --> 00:27:04.339
Renaud-ZKNOX: So, basically, this is, this is the… the staking, the rest is, the cost, for… for… for the bundler, so…

178
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.749
Renaud-ZKNOX: So yeah, you… you have everything to… to run.

179
00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.329
Renaud-ZKNOX: To run the demonstration, yourself.

180
00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:24.340
Antonio Sanso: This is… this is beautiful right now. I think, like, that this will give really a segue for what Nico will show next, because basically, like, I think you are doing this demo using non-Native account abstractions.

181
00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:33.530
Antonio Sanso: But, Nico actually probably is gonna show the long-term plan for, like, an abstraction, and part of it was already presented last week.

182
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:35.810
Antonio Sanso: at the ACDE.

183
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.220
Antonio Sanso: So…

184
00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:41.649
Renaud-ZKNOX: Yeah, that's really what we need, to have something native, so we don't have this.

185
00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:42.170
Antonio Sanso: Right.

186
00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:54.409
Renaud-ZKNOX: Kind of. So today, actually, it's not a big risk, it's more DDoS, because you can front-run the deployment. So I guess, as long as you don't send value, it's just, like.

187
00:27:54.620 --> 00:28:00.389
Renaud-ZKNOX: Pissing off, but not, phones are not at risk, but to be totally clean, and totally…

188
00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:00.920
Antonio Sanso: Right.

189
00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.020
Renaud-ZKNOX: We need this native,

190
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:16.179
Renaud-ZKNOX: This is really the missing point, to have the native AA, and we would gladly integrate our demonstration into this native AI when there is the possibility to do so.

191
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:32.029
Antonio Sanso: Perfect. Thanks a lot, Renault and Simon, for this beautiful presentation and demo. It was really, really nice of this in action, actually. And I think this is, again, a perfect segue for the next stuff, that is Nico. And yeah, there is a lot of questions in the chat.

192
00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:46.240
Antonio Sanso: But I think, like, if there is one thing that is fixed, then we know that it's gonna stay, so we don't have clarity which algorithm we're gonna deploy, which AP it's gonna be, but I think all we agree here that account abstraction is the fundament, is the basis

193
00:28:46.240 --> 00:29:00.429
Antonio Sanso: For anything we're gonna choose. And, that's, that's, Nico. If you're here, feel free to share the screen. And, I don't know, Reno, probably you need to stop sharing the screen. Thanks a lot.

194
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:00.800
Nico Consigny: I think…

195
00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:01.520
Antonio Sanso: I should've…

196
00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:06.129
Nico Consigny: Yeah, I think it's okay, I… I won't be, sharing the screen, I would just be,

197
00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:07.060
Antonio Sanso: Okay, perfect.

198
00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.080
Nico Consigny: a small… Oh my gosh, no.

199
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.449
Renaud-ZKNOX: I stopped sharing, I stopped sharing.

200
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:12.960
Antonio Sanso: Okay. Great.

201
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.600
Nico Consigny: it's…

202
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.310
Renaud-ZKNOX: Okay, the mic to Nico now.

203
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.989
Nico Consigny: Alright, so yeah, thanks for… thanks for having me,

204
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:27.299
Nico Consigny: So I work at the time of foundation. I've been doing a lot of account abstraction stuff over the last few years.

205
00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:35.040
Nico Consigny: It's kind of a full circle moment for me, because I started my career 10 years ago in a crypto analysis company.

206
00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:38.520
Nico Consigny: Selling, post-quantum transition to…

207
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.909
Nico Consigny: Banks and, and, different,

208
00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:48.950
Nico Consigny: high, security companies, so it's glad to see that this transition is coming to Ethereum.

209
00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.150
Nico Consigny: So…

210
00:29:51.600 --> 00:30:05.929
Nico Consigny: Account abstraction. We have been doing a lot of different account abstraction stuff on Ethereum over the last few years. The one that is compatible with post-quantum cryptography is 43.27.

211
00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:10.409
Nico Consigny: 4237 is, a near sea, so it's,

212
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:13.250
Nico Consigny: A standard that is not in protocol.

213
00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:20.490
Nico Consigny: So it is a great standard, but it comes with a lot of drawback, because it's not natively in the protocol.

214
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:32.610
Nico Consigny: So it has a gas cost overhead. It is, slower than a native transaction, because you have to, to go through some, bundle, an entry point, so…

215
00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:44.540
Nico Consigny: there is a lot of complexity around this. The main complexity also comes from gas management, because when you do this, you have to manage a lot of gas parameters.

216
00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:50.370
Nico Consigny: So these are the reasons, motivating, native account abstraction.

217
00:30:50.610 --> 00:31:03.420
Nico Consigny: So native account abstraction was envisioned from the very start of Ethereum. It is basically the cool thing that you can do with a smart contract is to have arbitrary logic.

218
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:11.799
Nico Consigny: So it's very sad that we have these very cool smart contract properties, but we don't apply them to wallets natively.

219
00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.779
Nico Consigny: So finally, this is what native AA is trying to solve.

220
00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:23.379
Nico Consigny: And so very recently, we had a new, proposal, which is, 8141,

221
00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:27.129
Nico Consigny: And it's called the Frame Transaction Proposal.

222
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:36.640
Nico Consigny: So what it is, it's simply a new transaction type, so the type is 0X6, yeah, if I'm not mistaken, yeah, 06.

223
00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:41.239
Nico Consigny: And it, replaces the current,

224
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:50.100
Nico Consigny: ECDSA signature model with a flexible frame system where you have a validation frame, an execution frame.

225
00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.440
Nico Consigny: And, a default, frame, a verified frame.

226
00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:59.280
Nico Consigny: And basically, you can iterate through these, frames, and…

227
00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:07.150
Nico Consigny: each frame is approved or reverted. If a frame is reverted, the entire transaction is going to be

228
00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:09.699
Nico Consigny: It's gonna… it's gonna be reverted.

229
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:20.659
Nico Consigny: So during the verification frame, you are actually not spending gas. It's like a read-only function, so it's like a status call.

230
00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:31.139
Nico Consigny: So if your transaction reverts during, the verify phase, it's… it's actually not that bad. You're not losing money. If it reverts during the…

231
00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:39.379
Nico Consigny: execution, frame, then it's more problematic, because you're actually, Spending money to do it.

232
00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:43.450
Nico Consigny: And so what DSLOs is,

233
00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:59.369
Nico Consigny: You have a transaction payload that is going to be hashed, and the signature is going to be outside of this payload, so you can have an arbitrary signature that you like to match the…

234
00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:10.670
Nico Consigny: to match the transaction that you want to have. So this is very nice, because this is flexible, it doesn't enshrine any scheme.

235
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:17.169
Nico Consigny: You could use… the Solidity verifier that ZKnox has been working on.

236
00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:24.720
Nico Consigny: The problem would be that the cost of this verifier is super high, so this is why we have the pre-compiled proposals.

237
00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:41.819
Nico Consigny: So this is, like, to give you a rough summary. If you want to dig more into the EIP, I invite you to read the specification. But basically, this is free frame. You have the default, mode, which is a call…

238
00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:59.939
Nico Consigny: to the entry point to either deploy a contract or to have someone to pay for the transaction, you have the verify frame, which is the verification of the signature, and you have the sender frame, which executes the user call with the

239
00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:04.009
Nico Consigny: Account address, so you're directly executing your call yourself.

240
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:11.590
Nico Consigny: So yeah, I invite you to dig the proposal if you're interested, but to focus on the…

241
00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:22.690
Nico Consigny: on the cryptography, what it enables is some crypto agility, so Dano will be talking a little bit more about this. So yeah, it enables…

242
00:34:24.089 --> 00:34:43.549
Antonio Sanso: Yeah, thanks a lot. Just, like, there are a couple of questions on the chat, I don't know if you see that. Thanks a lot for this, the introduction of this new EIP. It's actually really interesting, I was really happy to see this last week. And the first one, actually, quickly want to address it, we'll go back to Renault. Is this actually KIL7701, or is this, like, an…

243
00:34:44.039 --> 00:34:44.979
Antonio Sanso: Or to…

244
00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:56.439
Nico Consigny: It actually is, built on top of the 7701 proposal, so it's like, yeah, it replaces 7701 entirely.

245
00:34:57.099 --> 00:35:03.029
Antonio Sanso: And Renault is asking what happens to the old 4337 thingy? It continues to stay, or…

246
00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:10.680
Nico Consigny: That's a good question. You mean the URC itself will, yeah, continue to exist?

247
00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:20.610
Nico Consigny: it will continue to exist and to work. Obviously, you would have a easier time just switching to the full native AA, but

248
00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:27.459
Nico Consigny: the existing 4337 infra and wallet would continue working.

249
00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:32.910
Nico Consigny: Obviously, there would be some… native migration path, I assume?

250
00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:38.329
Nico Consigny: Like most of the 4337, wallets, I assume, would,

251
00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:45.650
Nico Consigny: offer you to upgrade to a native AA account. I mean, that just makes sense for… Yeah, I mean…

252
00:35:45.710 --> 00:36:00.670
Antonio Sanso: Yeah. What I will expect, like, this will fly, I will expect, like, a transition phase, but then you don't have really motivation to stay on the legacy system, and we'll expect that after a while, people will just go to the native solution.

253
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.440
Nico Consigny: Yep.

254
00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:02.890
Antonio Sanso: Right.

255
00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:03.320
Nico Consigny: Exactly.

256
00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:10.219
Antonio Sanso: Cool. Thanks a lot, Nico, and again, probably this is not gonna be the last time we talk about account abstraction in these, breakout rooms.

257
00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:26.089
Antonio Sanso: again, for me, like, the CAN abstraction is really, like, the base where we ship on, and probably we may need some kind of way to integrate properly, with the canned abstraction, so all the AIP that will come out of this, this work.

258
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.800
Antonio Sanso: We'll need to be, counter abstraction aware, somehow.

259
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:43.340
Nico Consigny: Absolutely, and just to… one last word on the roadmap, so we have the native AI on the roadmap, then we would have a, let's say, a selection phase of different schemes, or different precompiles.

260
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.979
Nico Consigny: That would come right after.

261
00:36:46.170 --> 00:37:02.779
Nico Consigny: And then, later down the road, we would have to discuss how to aggregate the signatures on the execution layer, because as we said, they're way bigger than regular transactions, so if this becomes the default type, it would be nice to aggregate them so we don't take a 10.

262
00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:03.330
Antonio Sanso: Right.

263
00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:04.240
Nico Consigny: slow down.

264
00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:16.760
Antonio Sanso: All right, let me tell you something on this. This is, like, of course, it's the call number one, but for call number two, we'll have already, some presentation on the topic. We have someone presenting about,

265
00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:23.949
Antonio Sanso: aggregation of Wisconsin signatures is a tough, problem, unfortunately, because we don't have, like, a BLS…

266
00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:35.110
Antonio Sanso: style post-quantum schemes, but yeah, that's, welcome in the post-quantum world, where we have everything is, a bit uglier.

267
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:43.000
Antonio Sanso: Anyway, I think next is, I don't know if it's Fabrizio or Stefano presenting? I think Stefano, right?

268
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:43.840
Stefa: Yup.

269
00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:49.110
Antonio Sanso: Cool. Stefan, I don't know if you want to share yours. Thanks a lot again, Nico, for this, and

270
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.309
Antonio Sanso: Like, let's go with the next presenter, Stefano.

271
00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.220
Stefa: Excellent.

272
00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:59.220
Stefa: So let me just share the slides. I have some slides just as a…

273
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.629
Stefa: There's a talk, can you see them?

274
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:02.730
Antonio Sanso: Yep.

275
00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:11.870
Stefa: Don't see myself anymore, but yep. Alright, yeah, excellent. So, a brief, brief presentation about our…

276
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:23.140
Stefa: a proposal we've been working on, with, Fabrizio, some other collaborators, and now recently also Antonio, on, a slightly different

277
00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:36.379
Stefa: approach to quantum mitigation, less patch, less a solution to the problem, so post-quantum signature adoption and implementation, and more, mitigation

278
00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:46.799
Stefa: for unforeseen emergencies, is what you could describe what Vitalik described in 2024 as a graceful emergency fallback. So, something which can be done today.

279
00:38:46.800 --> 00:39:10.450
Stefa: Or in the next, like, few weeks or a couple of months, well before quantum threats become realistic, but which would secure Ethereum in case of an unexpected quantum breakthrough. So, what happens if we are wrong about the timeline in quantum technology? I am myself from a quantum computing background. I know most of the people who work in some of the

280
00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:11.929
Stefa: major manufacturers.

281
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:28.570
Stefa: And some of them are, like, more advanced on timeline than they might publicly disclose. And so I think we need… we believe we need a mitigation strategy that can work in the event of an emergency, can deploy fast enough, or in fact can be already deployed.

282
00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:44.520
Stefa: In order to avoid, sort of, an ecosystem crash before protocol-level post-quantum EIPs can deploy, because these are more complicated, they require, changes at the protocol level, the timeline is not quite as, quite as nimble, and at the same time, I think

283
00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:54.279
Stefa: We don't want to be in a situation where we make a hasty decision of the definitive cryptographic primitive we want to adopt for post-quantum signatures.

284
00:39:54.280 --> 00:40:08.840
Stefa: Because there might be a minor tail risk that something will happen earlier than expected. So, there should be a way to buy us time to make the right decision, but at the same time to have a fallback in case something unexpected happened. And so these…

285
00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:28.340
Stefa: is the… this was sort of the guiding principle for our work, for the work we're doing. We want to have a user space mitigation solution, a shorter mitigation solution, so something which can be deployed now and ultimately will become unnecessary when a more permanent solution is deployed. It should

286
00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:49.040
Stefa: cover the majority, if not totality, of hardware wallets and software wallets, so we want almost all users to be covered. It should occur entirely on-chain, should be at Layer 1, there shouldn't be hard forks, new transaction types, trust intermediaries, none of that. It should be, like, a pure Layer 1 solution, no modification required to the apps that need to adopt it, and most importantly.

287
00:40:49.040 --> 00:41:02.589
Stefa: contrary to many other mitigation strategies, no user action required, because we believe that this is likely to be a black swan or tail event. It's hard to convince users that they should change the way they use the chain today.

288
00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:12.170
Stefa: but we still deploy something which protects them regardless. And so these are… I mean, these are the Zirata, of course, and we can see how far we can get with what we have.

289
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:30.609
Stefa: The proposal we came up with, and this is still work in progress, so of course, any questions, all questions welcome, is to implement something, on the lines of the, of Vitalik's 2024 proposal, and then, this is based on our SATAD,

290
00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:39.879
Stefa: proof-lifting, ideas, we lift the, current quantum weak schemes, so East DSA, to quantum resistance schemes.

291
00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:52.879
Stefa: via ZK proof of some pyramid for some step in the key generation process that is hard to invert with quantum computers. So, for example, cryptographic hashing is believed to be impossible to invert with quantum computers.

292
00:41:52.880 --> 00:42:02.430
Stefa: Practically impossible, of course. And so that is the target for our… for the first step of our work, which is what we could call proof of seed, is what we're talking about today.

293
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:16.620
Stefa: And the second step in the work is to say, oh, okay, Ethereum, specifically Ethereum, because the proof of seed works for pretty much every chain, really. It's a Bitcoin-compatible thing, it's a Solana-compatible thing, but Ethereum has a kind of abstraction.

294
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:31.529
Stefa: and the delegation features that have already been accepted into the protocol and are widely used and widely supported. And so we can use that proof of seed to provide ways for users to, with one click, switch from a weak account to a resisted account.

295
00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:37.179
Stefa: At the time of the emergency, even though their key at that time might already be broken.

296
00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:48.380
Stefa: And so, in that way, we protect everybody without previous action. So today, I'm going to focus briefly on our progress on the first step, so practically achieving proof of seed, which was an interesting challenge.

297
00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:54.349
Stefa: We focused mostly on BIP32 derivation, so hierarchical deterministic wallets.

298
00:42:54.540 --> 00:43:03.839
Stefa: by the point that many, many other key generation schemes involve hashing at some point, and so similar techniques could be applicable, it's just they're not as standardized as BIP32.

299
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:21.929
Stefa: In BIP32, there are multiple BIP32 and BIP39 mnemonics. There are multiple opportunities for post-quantum lifting. If you have a child key with some non-exposed parent or ancestor key, for example, a master key that has not been exposed.

300
00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:45.389
Stefa: then you can do this lifting to the ancestor. You can say, I know the ancestor key from which this child key was derived, and that's protected, because it cannot be inverted. If you have an exposed master key, which has been raised as a point of contention for some of these approaches, well, you can actually list it to the master seed, and there are ordinarily no reasons that the master seed would have been exposed, unless it has been compromised.

301
00:43:45.550 --> 00:44:07.570
Stefa: In which case, for BIP32, it sort of ends there, you've lost the master seed, and that's it. But if you have a BIP39 master seed derivation from mnemonic, then there are 2048 more hashing steps in between. And you can just go to the previous one. Typically, those hashing steps, the outcomes of those hashing steps are not stored in the hardware wallets, or within the wallets in general.

302
00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:13.589
Stefa: And so it's unlikely that those intermediate steps, or do you… Original mnemonic have been exposed.

303
00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:32.209
Stefa: And those intermediate steps, like the last one, for example, can be used as the witness to lift the master seed, and even recover from compromised master seed, which is pretty useful. There are some challenges to make things interesting, because otherwise, where's the fun? Proof generation for…

304
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:51.839
Stefa: succinct techniques is typically memory-intensive, and one of the biggest constraints for secure elements, which are the… one of the most common ways of implementing, like, hardware-secure wallets, is that they have really, really tight memory constraints. We're talking a few dozen kilobytes at best.

305
00:44:52.150 --> 00:45:12.129
Stefa: If we talk heap space, it's maybe less than 10 kilobytes. So, unlikely that any of the succinct techniques could be easily implemented. There are several challenges there. Of course, I'm happy to be contradicted, and I'm happy to be told that there are some nice techniques that can be made to fit, but the ones that we could think of wouldn't fit.

306
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:18.780
Stefa: What we can do is we can use some slightly older techniques that are not succinct, such as MPC and NAT,

307
00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:36.410
Stefa: Use those to do the proving on element, use stream proofs, which are incredibly memory-lite. You can make them have a footprint that is within a tiny, tiny constant of the footprint of the original algorithm you're trying to prove, so it should fit. It's like 2 kilobytes, 1.5 kilobytes, it's really nothing.

308
00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:55.750
Stefa: And then what you do is, this is the step that extracts the secret from the secure element. And at that point, the secret can be sent to anybody. Like, any machine, untrusted or trusted, paid or unpaid, can do the next step, which is the recursive verification. So you take this and use stark recursive verification to produce a succinct proof.

309
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.249
Stefa: of the statement, I know a proof.

310
00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:11.320
Stefa: that there was a pre-image to this hashing step, and then that's the one that is used for on-chain verification, and on-chain verification for that is reasonably cheap, especially if we approve VIPs for the number theoretic transform.

311
00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:33.619
Stefa: The other minor challenge, I mean, minor in the sense that it is, it's more of a political problem than a technical one, is that lifting child keys to non-exposed ancestor keys, and in particular to a non-exposed master key, is something we can do in user app space for these devices. Typically, the master key is available, and therefore even just make an app.

312
00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:36.520
Stefa: That has access to the master key and uses it to lift.

313
00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:48.389
Stefa: The problem is that if we have exposed master keys, or even compromised seats, which are typically unrecoverable, we would need access to secure OS internals for this to work.

314
00:46:48.660 --> 00:47:03.370
Stefa: Two possible solutions, depending on the risk appetite, I guess. One is integrating the MPC in the head primitives directly in the secure OS. They're actually quite flexible, and they allow you to do a lot of interesting things, so that might be something which could be done, or could be useful.

315
00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:11.960
Stefa: Over alternative, some limited exposure of either the master seed or the pre-image to the final hashing step in the BIP39 derivation.

316
00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:14.980
Stefa: I am aware that these are things that make

317
00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:24.279
Stefa: people's skin cryptograph versus skin itch, but, I mean, we're talking about extreme measures, and so it could be possible that this would be a solution.

318
00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:36.210
Stefa: We are continuing to work on this. We should have a concrete implementation with the demonstrator out soon on our repositories.

319
00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:47.909
Stefa: In the next, like, couple of weeks, we want to, like, push this step hard, we want to have a full demonstrator ready by each CCC for this. The account abstraction part is the next one.

320
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:57.520
Stefa: And I imagine that, given our passion for account obstruction in this breakout room, I'm sure that we will have more opportunities in the future to talk about it.

321
00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:06.400
Antonio Sanso: Great. Thanks a lot, Stefano. Two things here. I see that Fabrizio, thanks a lot, answered already a lot of questions that were made on the chat. Thanks a lot.

322
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.199
Stefa: I didn't even see. I was so focused on chatting, or talking.

323
00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:29.150
Antonio Sanso: Yeah, yeah, no, this is good, I mean, you were working pair. And, there are things, like, that, Renault in the chat, I knew about that, but here he's actually saying as well. They have been working on kind of, similar topics, at least for the derivation of BIP39, and I think, really, here, it will be really nice to, to, to have, like.

324
00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:48.570
Antonio Sanso: there's a great synergy here, and I think we should try to collaborate on this, because the work are actually really compatible, and they're really… I'm really happy to see this actually happening. Thanks a lot for the presentation. I know that Dano has a really hard and tight schedule, so Dano, I think that,

325
00:48:49.280 --> 00:49:01.000
Antonio Sanso: You can go ahead with your… with your talk, and then maybe we come back to discuss about something more. But I know that you have to go, right, Dano? So you're really into the presentation right now. Exactly.

326
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.749
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: Can I get the screen?

327
00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:08.429
Antonio Sanso: Yeah, Steven. Thanks a lot, Tegan, Stephan, for presenting, that was really insightful.

328
00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:12.880
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: Alright.

329
00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:22.500
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: So, the topic I've been asked to speak about is something that I think is really important to this whole transaction signature migration format, is a concept called cryptographic agility.

330
00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:25.780
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: Let me get that on the right screen…

331
00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:36.270
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: So, cryptographic agility, as a short discussion, what he means here is the ability, if we can add or remove cryptographic algorithms without requiring major changes to Ethereum.

332
00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:48.559
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: And on the bottom is a very rigorous, formal definition that NIST uses when they do their discussions about cryptographic agility.

333
00:49:48.660 --> 00:50:01.630
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: And the reason that I put that down there is to note that the problems that we're facing with cryptographic agility are not unique to Ethereum. There are lots of systems out there that need to migrate from lift-to-curve and RSA signatures to much more robust

334
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:13.070
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: much different post-quantum signature algorithms, and they're having problems migrating this. So, if the protocol or the piece of software integrated cryptographic agility, it wouldn't be that much of a problem.

335
00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:21.229
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: So, to demonstrate that, I'm gonna talk about our current Ethereum transactions, which I don't consider to be cryptographically agile.

336
00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:37.029
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: So what we see here right now is what's called the signature form of a transaction. It's the… the 9 items that are used to do, in this case, a 1559 transaction. So you take your signing device, whether it's a hardware wallet or your software wallet.

337
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:47.639
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: And you calculate 3 specific values from a very specific ECDSA algorithm, the V, the R, and the S. And the V even has different numbers that you would use in different contexts.

338
00:50:47.790 --> 00:51:02.930
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: And then you take these, and you smash them together into one transaction, with the V, the R, and the S in values. So the very format that is expected over the wire has written into it a specific algorithm, and not only that, specific links and specific contextual meanings.

339
00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:10.369
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: So if we want to do something like, use Edwards, which would have a different construction, where you need to provide a public key and a signature.

340
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:25.940
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: we would have to go through and change the final form of this, or if it's a public… in this case, post-quantums, you also have to provide, typically, the public key and the signature. We would have to change the format of the output transaction, have it different between ECDSA and,

341
00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:39.080
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: whatever alternate signature algorithm might be out there. They could not live together at the same time, they would have to have separate parsing paths. So this next slide, represents kind of what the solution that other people have gone with, gone through. This is kind of what,

342
00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:50.399
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: Hedera does, even though they use Edwards, the same with Cosmos, and this is something Off-chain Labs had proposed during the blob, during the merge, before the blobs, before blobs-based became less problematic.

343
00:51:50.400 --> 00:52:00.029
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: And the idea here is you take the signature form, and you do make it part of the canatical form of the transaction, and you take the signatures, and you make it a separate piece of data that you could

344
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:04.770
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: snap together like the Lego brick, or pull out, and you wrap it together in an outer container.

345
00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:20.020
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: So the advantage of a more agile format like this is if you want to change the signature to something like Falcon, the only thing you have to change is the signature component. You don't need to change any part of the transaction, and you can just unsnap that LEGO and snap that other LEGO back in.

346
00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:34.079
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: And you can just very easily change into larger key sizes, like MLDSA, it's so big it doesn't fit on the screen. And that's how big these keys are. So you take the signature, and you just replace it there, and you don't have to change any of the logic that you're doing.

347
00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:52.620
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: with your signature form, you keep that signature form. You don't have to change any of the payload structure for how you're transmitting the transaction over the network, you just change the signature data, and the meaning of the signature data, and the protocol, and in the algorithms. And if you don't understand the signature data, you can still process this transaction and move it around to a limited extent.

348
00:52:53.330 --> 00:53:01.280
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: Now, one of the things this opens up that I heard mention in earlier discussions, it kind of goes in, is we can do wacky, fun things now that we have cryptographic agility.

349
00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:15.399
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: Like, we could no longer ship around these MLDSA signatures, we could put it in some ZK blob proof, and we could instead just put a stub there that says, this represents this address, and we rely on the ZK blob to say, here's the authentication. We let someone somewhere else deal with this.

350
00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:23.930
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: the way we aggregate these signatures together. Now, the way Off-Chain Labs originally proposed this was that this ZK proof would actually be a less aggregated signature.

351
00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:35.749
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: But, of course, we can't do that because we need to be post-quantum. But it's the same concept. You can aggregate the signatures, and if you make those signatures easily severable from the transaction body, it becomes much, much more simple to do that.

352
00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:40.360
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: So I wrote these slides, before the frame transaction came up. So here's the…

353
00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:40.840
Antonio Sanso: Right.

354
00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:42.660
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: None of them in the same color. Go ahead.

355
00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:50.500
Antonio Sanso: Sorry, Daniel, this was actually my exact question, how this integrates with the frame. We'll tell now how it integrates with the frame, or…

356
00:53:50.860 --> 00:54:06.339
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: I haven't had much time to speak about it, but it doesn't… I don't think it works terribly well, as you'll see. So here's the, the current, frame transaction. You have the frames in the middle, you have the signature here, and you basically, instead of the DK, you have the EVM over there.

357
00:54:06.490 --> 00:54:23.129
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: So, I mean, we can just, you know, change the signature, put different values in, and again, the hash-based signature, same problem, doesn't fit on the screen. But you can change these signatures, but one of the things we lose about this is the easily unsnap and snappability of the handling of it. You have to put the signature deep into the transaction.

358
00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:29.529
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: So I think, you know, that the frame-based transaction, we could possibly rework some of it and look and see how we can get the snappability there.

359
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:36.090
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: That's actually kind of a separate part from that, from the notion of the cryptographic utility that I really want to make.

360
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:37.790
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: And that is…

361
00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:43.339
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: For cryptographic agility, that probably means we're gonna have to support multiple algorithms at the same time.

362
00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:57.149
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: We're not just gonna… it's not like the consensus layer. We can say, okay, today we're BLS, tomorrow we're Christmas signatures. It's… it's not gonna be a one… a one-shot thing. There's gonna be time where we're gonna have to support ECDSA and whatever post-quantum signatures we support.

363
00:54:57.310 --> 00:55:07.359
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: Similarly, it means that with cryptographic agility, we can add and remove these signatures at separate times. We could add MLDSA next week, we could add SNDSA and the fork after that.

364
00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:18.509
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: We can take ETDSA out in 2030, or 2035, and leave the other signatures in place. If there is a break on Lattice, we can remove all the Lattice signatures and tell everyone they have to rely on hash-based signatures.

365
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:28.580
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: Cryptographic agility provides us the ability to respond to the changing nature of cryptography without having to completely rewrite our transaction signature protocols.

366
00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:39.320
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: In our transaction formatting things, the collateral damage that's going to happen by changing a signature that is unnecessary if we do a little bit of forward design to make sure that we can handle these signatures independently.

367
00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:58.640
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: So, in summary, it just means that CA means that we're no longer tied to a specific algorithm, and then we can swap them. And I listed here some of the examples that we're looking for in the future. These are the currently standardized ones, and these are ones that are coming up in the next round. Isogyny, symmetric, multivariate.

368
00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:12.839
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: Hash base, codebase. So there's all sorts of things out there. It's a really open space. We don't know which one of these is going to get the nod. And I put rainbow on here, because that was part of the first… it was a multivariate in the first series, and really late in the process, there was a crack on the algorithm.

369
00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:21.670
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: It was compromised with classical computers. So that just emphasizes why we need to be able to, for these new cryptography, be able to add and remove them with a minimum of effort and pain.

370
00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:37.349
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: So, that's what I have to say about cryptographic agility. However we do it, it's something that we need to keep in mind as a design principle for these signatures to make sure that we don't have to have another big, long series of breakout rooms again when whatever we pick happens to get cracked.

371
00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:50.270
Antonio Sanso: Thanks a lot, Daniel. A quick question, like, is there any chance for you to integrate and talk with the frame transaction people? Because this looks really relevant to that, so…

372
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.590
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: Nope.

373
00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:58.639
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: I just learned about it last Thursday, and we're currently in our East Denver, death march, so I haven't had time to poke my head out a bunch of anything.

374
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:59.800
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: I've got a…

375
00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.390
Antonio Sanso: Does that mean you have to do.

376
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:06.940
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: But yes, I think I should talk with them, and I should get involved. I just… I learned about it a week ago, and I haven't had much time to integrate.

377
00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:21.600
Antonio Sanso: Sure, totally, but from my perspective, I wouldn't see two different efforts separate. I will see, like, one effort, and the idea you got on this, integrating that effort, I mean, will be the way to go, in my opinion, right?

378
00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:24.919
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: Yep, and yeah, there's, there's other things.

379
00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:29.740
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: floating in the process that we need to let, finish before I can really talk too much about what we're doing, so…

380
00:57:30.330 --> 00:57:43.810
Antonio Sanso: Okay, cool, cool. So, this ended up the presentation before to, like, having some discussion on… in general. I would like to say a few more words. So, this was call number one. In two weeks, we have call number two.

381
00:57:43.820 --> 00:58:04.500
Antonio Sanso: And, we didn't… we had some topic that we didn't fit in today's, present, hour, and I see some people already here that, probably will be… make sense to present next week, or next week, sorry. And one thing that we missed completely is the multi… sorry, that,

382
00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:17.200
Antonio Sanso: multi-signatures, and I see Jay on the call, and this is a really important topic, so we want to actually present, preserve the fact that, you have threshold… threshold scheme present, for,

383
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:29.810
Antonio Sanso: So we don't lose these capabilities, and we… again, we already said that we want to see, as well, the aggregatable signatures, but again, one hour was not enough to cover all these topics, so today we start like this.

384
00:58:30.130 --> 00:58:34.409
Antonio Sanso: And, right, this was really…

385
00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:37.610
Antonio Sanso: good first call, we, we touched.

386
00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:39.820
Antonio Sanso: Grasp on several topics.

387
00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:51.319
Antonio Sanso: If there's someone who wants to say something, on… on the question on the chat that was not answered anywhere, this will be a right moment. We'll have 10 minutes.

388
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:59.319
Antonio Sanso: I checked the chart, many questions were answered.

389
00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:05.239
Antonio Sanso: But I don't know if someone… some… is anyone that asked a question that was not answered in the chat who wants to repeat here?

390
00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:10.910
Fab: If, if I may address very quickly,

391
00:59:10.970 --> 00:59:28.379
Fab: I've seen a lot of questions in the chat about, you know, especially apps that need to be updated and stuff like that. Our main concern at the moment is not with developers. We very much trust that, you know, as soon as the Ethereum's general direction is clear and there is a path.

392
00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:41.050
Fab: developers will migrate proactively. Same goes for validators, node operators, everyone that is part of these infrastructure, you know, institutions. The real problem here is

393
00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:46.080
Fab: with average Joe, you know, like, the normal kind of user that doesn't…

394
00:59:46.080 --> 01:00:00.459
Fab: follow developments too closely, and that basically, you know, we cannot expect to proactively migrate. This is the main thing that we want to, solve with this ZK-based patch.

395
01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:12.710
Fab: Everything else, we are total confident that, you know, the ecosystem will adapt and will follow whatever guidelines are established. They… it always did, so why should I do it this time?

396
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:33.230
Antonio Sanso: I do agree, and again, like, I just want to say something that at least is a… I kind of changed mind in the last year on this cryptographic agility. I mean, in the past, I was actually on the mind that we will have, at least, from the beginning, one single signature being deployed post-quantum for,

397
01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:38.469
Antonio Sanso: For the transaction signals, but, I think, like, that…

398
01:00:38.560 --> 01:01:01.600
Antonio Sanso: what will happen is that we probably, likely, we are going to try to have multiple EIPs and let people choose their own poisons, because of poison we're talking about here, compared to elliptical curve size, everything is a poison here. So, I'm happy that, for example, Renault already showed today that exact… it's already possible today to do a transaction using the lithium.

399
01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:02.969
Antonio Sanso: With about $10.

400
01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:14.070
Antonio Sanso: And, yeah, so let's see how it goes. Better, probably, because, I mean, if we put an EIP, the better and solidity. Dano, I see your… I see your hand.

401
01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:30.349
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: Yeah, so one of the things to consider when you're talking about multiple signatures is they all have different trade-offs, and different users might want different things. Some people are going to be absolutely obsessed with NAFC compliance, and some people are more concerned about staying away from lattices, because they think there's a break that's going to come on.

402
01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:37.410
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: Some want stuff that's gonna be able to be signed by a hardware wallet, and some are gonna be fine with a walled-off machine. These are some of the things that

403
01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:43.379
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: you know, I don't think there's any one signature that's going to satisfy literally everyone, and these are some pretty hard requirements.

404
01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:51.969
Antonio Sanso: Yeah, that's why, again, I said, pick your poison, because I agree totally with you, I mean, then we'll have the user pick their own thing.

405
01:01:52.040 --> 01:02:07.360
Antonio Sanso: And again, like, this is already, again, possible today. If you want to pay $10 for a postcardo transaction, you can, thanks to the work done by DKNOX, it's already possible right now. So, this is amazing, if you ask me. This is really the beauty and the power of, like, an abstraction.

406
01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:17.739
Antonio Sanso: And if Nico is as well here, I want to ask him about… he mentioned to me privately that there is, as well as some EIP that is,

407
01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:25.209
Antonio Sanso: That will be, will actually… you will be able to revoke your elliptical

408
01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:28.019
Antonio Sanso: Private key, right, Nico? Something like this.

409
01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:30.680
Antonio Sanso: Yeah, exactly.

410
01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:34.199
Nico Consigny: Yeah, actually it's fun that you mention it, because I'm…

411
01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.619
Nico Consigny: opening a PR right now to update this.

412
01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:40.960
Antonio Sanso: Oh, okay, okay. You want to describe quickly?

413
01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:44.269
Nico Consigny: So, what it would do, basically,

414
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:55.380
Nico Consigny: To put it simply, it would add a flag, to the… to the wallet, to the address, and this flag would indicate that the address is in a deactivate state.

415
01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:59.089
Nico Consigny: So it would be an additional byte at the end.

416
01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:14.439
Nico Consigny: And the way it would work is you would have a time lock, you would have a delay, basically, to revoke your cancellation. So it's… for now, we're saying 7 days, so… 7 days, so for… during this period, you can either cancel

417
01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:25.610
Nico Consigny: your request to deactivate your EOA, and if you get to the full 7 days, then your, EOA, ECDSA key would be deactivated forever.

418
01:03:25.630 --> 01:03:28.770
Nico Consigny: So this is, like, just the IP to deactivate the…

419
01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:38.999
Nico Consigny: the EOA key, but we would also need an EIP to modify the EC Recover precompile, because unfortunately, you have,

420
01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:55.269
Nico Consigny: a permit, and you have some option protocols that are using EC Recover to move funds, and in the case of a post-quantum attacker, the post-quantum attacker could actually sign a message with your ECDSA key.

421
01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.790
Nico Consigny: So there is the CIP incoming, this is,

422
01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:08.610
Nico Consigny: EIP7851, and there will be an additional EIP, to… to change the EC Recover precompile.

423
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:14.239
Antonio Sanso: Right. I think this will be really good to be seen in one of the next calls.

424
01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:21.050
Antonio Sanso: We are almost at time. I think for today, we… it was a really packed call. I hope to have a more…

425
01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:29.020
Antonio Sanso: a lean call next time with less packed agenda, so we can go a bit deeper.

426
01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:42.310
Antonio Sanso: I will try to collect synergies that I've seen today, and connect a few of you privately, for example, ZKnox and Nethermind. I think that you guys are working on…

427
01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:50.790
Antonio Sanso: similar things. I see as well, Dano, I will invite you again to collaborate with the account abstraction people on different transactions.

428
01:04:50.890 --> 01:04:59.260
Antonio Sanso: And, again, we just started, I'm sure that this is gonna be a really fun ride for many of us. The more, the better.

429
01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:07.280
Antonio Sanso: And, I think that's, that's… that's it for today. Unless someone else has a question.

430
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:09.870
Antonio Sanso: I will give you back 2 minutes of your life.

431
01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:19.860
Antonio Sanso: All right, cool. Thanks a lot again, to all the presenters and the people that attended today's call. See you in two weeks!

432
01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:21.360
Antonio Sanso: Bye-bye.

433
01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.610
Simon - ZKNOX: But…

434
01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:26.080
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: Thanks. Don't forget to like and subscribe.

435
01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:28.510
Antonio Sanso: Exactly.
