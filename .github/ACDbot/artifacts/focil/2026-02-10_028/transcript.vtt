00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.420
Katya: Hello.

2
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.120
Jihoon: Hello!

3
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.950
Jihoon: You can wait just a few more minutes.

4
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:41.390
Jihoon: Alright, I think we can just begin. It doesn't seem like we're gonna spring more people.

5
00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:45.709
Jihoon: So, can you guys hear me okay?

6
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.360
Jihoon: Alright, thank you.

7
00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.050
Jihoon: Okay, so hello everyone, welcome to Fossil Breakout 28.

8
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.680
Jihoon: Today we can share a little bit about

9
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:09.819
Jihoon: The headliner status, and then share some development updates, as always.

10
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:17.239
Jihoon: So, for the headliner side, we proposed a fossil for a headliner for Hakota.

11
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:22.420
Jihoon: Slightly after the last breakout call, we made a proposal.

12
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:26.140
Jihoon: Here's the link in case anyone missed it.

13
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:40.399
Jihoon: And to my understanding, we'll be deciding the CL headliner in the next ACDC, which is on the 19th, so please check that call if you are available.

14
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:48.309
Jihoon: Alongside with it, I'm currently working on to updating Fossil spec.

15
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.170
Jihoon: starting from the CL spec, and then…

16
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.330
Jihoon: Execution spec and engine API spec.

17
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.970
Jihoon: The CL spec should be ready by next, say, CDC, that's our plan.

18
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:10.169
Jihoon: Yeah, so for the CL spec, I'm thinking about two main changes there.

19
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:20.059
Jihoon: So, one is about IELT bit list inclusivity check, and the second one is about, IELT compliance check.

20
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:25.469
Jihoon: Yeah, actually, I was thinking about…

21
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:34.380
Jihoon: how can I explain this nicely? And I made a… short scrape, so,

22
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.770
Jihoon: Let me share my screen.

23
00:10:54.910 --> 00:11:01.400
Jihoon: Let's see, okay, so, won't be long, don't be afraid. Can you guys see my screen?

24
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.589
Katya: Yes. Yeah.

25
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.269
Jihoon: Okay, cool, thank you.

26
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:15.219
Jihoon: So, there are two main changes, and I just wanted to explain what that is, because it's a little bit different from what we

27
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.940
Jihoon: Start back in the days, so… Let's start off.

28
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:27.310
Jihoon: with ILT bit list inclusivity check. So, we want to add the ILT bit list in the bid, so builders

29
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:32.290
Jihoon: build in this bit list indicating which IELTS they've considered

30
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:37.109
Jihoon: When building a block. And this serves as a good signal for a proposal.

31
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.669
Jihoon: whether the payload will satisfy the IR constraints.

32
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.549
Jihoon: It's not a guarantee, so builders can provide with

33
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:55.740
Jihoon: an IL-incompliant block at the end, but if you see a bid that has an inclusive IL bit list, you'd expect the corresponding payload

34
00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.350
Jihoon: would be IR compliant.

35
00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:07.370
Jihoon: And here, inclusive means the ILP place is a super superset of your local IL view, so…

36
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:20.540
Jihoon: If your view is, let's say, 11101, which means you didn't see the fourth IL, you expect bits with 11101 or 11111.

37
00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:28.090
Jihoon: And this inclusivity check can be done by either attesters or PTC.

38
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:33.310
Jihoon: The trade-off here is what to reorg when it's not inclusive.

39
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:41.079
Jihoon: If we go with our testers, we will gonna reorg become blocked, while PTC will reorg the envelope.

40
00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.680
Jihoon: But here, reorging Beacon Block gives us more…

41
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:55.280
Jihoon: made bigger impact, because we were not gonna… we were gonna miss the whole slot, basically. So I think using PTC here is better.

42
00:12:56.010 --> 00:13:01.300
Jihoon: And my next question was, can we do better? So…

43
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:14.679
Jihoon: Do we have to reorg envelope if the bit list is not inclusive? And my current thinking is it doesn't have to be, because the payload can be IL compliant.

44
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.959
Jihoon: Even when the petlist is not inclusive.

45
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:32.909
Jihoon: This can happen when the ILs overlap, so the missing IL doesn't really add any new transaction. And this is not unlikely, especially when an IL is able to include most of transactions in the public manpool.

46
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:41.730
Jihoon: So, my current proposal is to let's add IRB leads to the bid, and let PTC do vote for inclusivity.

47
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.179
Jihoon: But we didn't use it in the fork choice.

48
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:53.369
Jihoon: So, the IL bid list itself is informational purpose, so if you found a builder.

49
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.830
Jihoon: That makes a bid with not inclusive bid list.

50
00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:04.539
Jihoon: or they make the bid with inclusive bit lists, but with non… I mean.

51
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.419
Jihoon: ILN-compliant block. You can downscore them, for example.

52
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:20.489
Jihoon: But I'm not… but I'm not 100% sure if this is the way we have to go, so if you have any better idea or feedback, please let me know.

53
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.870
Jihoon: So, that was for…

54
00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:43.930
Jihoon: the IL bit less, and the second one is IL compliance check. So, when a tester for slot N receive an envelope for slot N-1, they check if it satisfies the IL constraints. In this case, let's assume that

55
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:50.279
Jihoon: It did… it's not IL compliant, so it misses this yellow transaction.

56
00:14:50.400 --> 00:15:02.570
Jihoon: Then, a tester stored this payload as ILN compliant, and when they receive a PICOM block for slot N, they expect it to extend the envelope for slot

57
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:12.420
Jihoon: N minus 2, not N minus 1. They vote for the beacon block, or if it correctly reuse the IRN-compliant envelope, so…

58
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:20.209
Jihoon: This is it, so these two changes will be the main changes of the usepec on top of Coloss.

59
00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:29.820
Jihoon: And… Yeah, sorry, I… I didn't see the, the… the raise then. Yes, Justin?

60
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:40.440
Justin Florentine (Besu): That's okay. I actually had a question on the, the bit list being a superset of what was in the beacon block, and maybe this is a stupid question.

61
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:51.550
Justin Florentine (Besu): how does the… how does the view merge allow for that? Like, aren't we saying that there are additional transactions that, not everybody may have seen?

62
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.409
Jihoon: Oh, so, that's…

63
00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:57.740
Justin Florentine (Besu): Go ahead. Yes, Bluth, go ahead.

64
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:15.389
Justin Florentine (Besu): No, I'm just… what I don't under… I guess, let me try to elaborate on the question a little bit. What I don't understand is that, we have a bit list of various inclusion lists, yeah? And that adds up to a list of transactions that need to be included, but…

65
00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:27.949
Justin Florentine (Besu): If what you're proposing is a superset of what was merged by the committee, couldn't you be asking to include transactions that not everybody has seen?

66
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:36.599
Jihoon: Or… For Builder, I guess, right? Because, like, when…

67
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:50.870
Jihoon: Yeah, build… but I think it doesn't hurt, because the builder ends up including more transactions than you expect, and it doesn't violate any of the fossil mechanisms, so what could go wrong is when…

68
00:16:50.970 --> 00:17:03.070
Jihoon: a builder gives you non-supperset IL view, then you probably don't want to accept a bid, because it might contain, it might not contain

69
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.109
Jihoon: I.O. transaction.

70
00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:10.330
Justin Florentine (Besu): Okay, so we check inclusion against the committee's subset inclusion list.

71
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:14.330
Jihoon: Not against what the actual proposer saw. Got it.

72
00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:15.930
Justin Florentine (Besu): That makes sense.

73
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.169
Justin Florentine (Besu): Sorry, thank you.

74
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:23.119
Jihoon: Yes, so, yeah, yeah, so, when, testers validate the,

75
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:31.870
Jihoon: IR constraints, they use their local IL view, not the one in the bit list. So…

76
00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:35.750
Jihoon: The bit list could be super sad, because proposer…

77
00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:41.930
Jihoon: Our builder have one more second to receive and update their IL view? Yeah.

78
00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:48.699
Justin Florentine (Besu): So they have no idea that the extra transaction was somebody's inclusion list, they just see it as an extra transaction, they don't care.

79
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:59.020
Jihoon: They actually receive… they might receive an inclusion list that a tester hasn't seen yet.

80
00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:07.679
Jihoon: Because they have some extra time to update their IL view. But the… when you are validating,

81
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.690
Jihoon: I.O. constraints.

82
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:19.500
Jihoon: what you carry is actually a set of transactions, not the number of ILs. So, there might be a case that… yeah, so that's why I think

83
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:31.329
Jihoon: It is better to not use IL BitLays inclusivity in our fork choice, because there could be a case that it is not a superset, but the payload itself is actually IL compliant.

84
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:32.670
Justin Florentine (Besu): Got it.

85
00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:34.060
Justin Florentine (Besu): Thank you.

86
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:36.180
Jihoon: Thank you.

87
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.830
Jihoon: Do we have any other question?

88
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:52.990
Mehdi Aouadi: Yeah, I'd like to ask a question, about the difference between the, PTC,

89
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.590
Mehdi Aouadi: Checks on the attester checks.

90
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:59.360
Mehdi Aouadi: So correct me if I'm wrong, but,

91
00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:07.920
Mehdi Aouadi: if we go with the, PTC checks, does that mean that there will be, no…

92
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:14.770
Mehdi Aouadi: Impact on the fork choice, because in my understanding, rearguing the envelope is done earlier, right?

93
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:21.629
Jihoon: Reworking the envelope.

94
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:30.650
Jihoon: Yes, because PTC doesn't… They… I mean, PTC vote doesn't say anything about

95
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:34.349
Jihoon: whether the payload is IL compliant or not.

96
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:42.910
Jihoon: But actually, so what… what I'm proposing is, let PTC to vote for the ILP list inclusivity.

97
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:56.729
Jihoon: So, whether the ILP is in the bid was a superset to their local IL view. But actually, it doesn't have to be PTC. I think you made the right point. It could be done by our testers.

98
00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:02.790
Jihoon: Because, yeah, I need to think a little bit more about this, because,

99
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.780
Jihoon: It's not… it's not set in stone yet, so…

100
00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:06.450
Mehdi Aouadi: Okay.

101
00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.970
Jihoon: Yeah, the… I think the Gist…

102
00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:21.410
Jihoon: that I wanted to convey is that, we want to add IR bit list to signal proposal that this corresponding payload would satisfy the IR constraint or not.

103
00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:30.200
Jihoon: But… And we also wanna ask testers or PTC to vote for ILB Middle East inclusivity.

104
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:48.520
Jihoon: But we don't want to… I think it's better to not use that information in our fork choice. But whether testers or PTC vote for that inclusivity check is something that we have to think a little bit more, so yeah.

105
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.140
Mehdi Aouadi: Okay, I see. Yeah, thanks.

106
00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:52.810
Jihoon: Thank you.

107
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:07.520
Jihoon: Do we have any other question, or anything's unclear, or seems weird?

108
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:16.899
Jihoon: Alright, I'm planning to make a PR

109
00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:19.499
Jihoon: By the end of this week, so…

110
00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:24.450
Jihoon: I think we can have more productive discussion once we have the code ready.

111
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:36.159
Jihoon: So, yeah, I'm pretty sure that we're gonna revisit this topic in the next breakout, so if my explanation was not clear enough, it's okay, we can just revisit it later.

112
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:42.730
Jihoon: And, yeah, so that was… all that I wanted to share.

113
00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:47.160
Jihoon: Do we have any other updates or something to discuss?

114
00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:58.909
Jihoon: Yes, Tyler?

115
00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:06.950
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah, I guess I can go over some of the research I've been doing on the different delays with the inclusion list.

116
00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:26.899
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: The data's a little messy with using the Excel data, from PandaOps, but, it's pretty much what everyone assumed with the current setup, with zero delay. 20% are…

117
00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:33.909
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: 20% of the transactions in the inclusion list are getting added to the next block,

118
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:53.499
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Regardless, so essentially, it's a wasted space, and when we move the delay to 1 and 2, it only increases by about 0.1%. It's still pretty messy, because there's a lot of spam transactions, and I can't check the state, since it's all historical data, but…

119
00:22:53.580 --> 00:23:07.699
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Other than that, and the censorship-only IOs, which are just transactions that have been flagged as censored, as you can expect, the delay doesn't really affect them, so…

120
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:13.780
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: I think a one, slot delay, as talked earlier, wouldn't be too bad, but…

121
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:21.789
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: I got some new data that I'm gonna go over soon from, Block Native, so hopefully that gives me a little bit more resolution, but yeah.

122
00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:32.209
Jihoon: So… if I understood you correctly, delaying it by one slot would give us better results, because

123
00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:35.090
Jihoon: It gives us extra 1%.

124
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:41.329
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Gives us extra 0.1%, so there's not much of a difference.

125
00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:54.330
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah, I'm not quite sure if it would really look like this, on, like, a live node with IELTS implemented, because we are having such a low inclusion rate of

126
00:23:54.550 --> 00:24:03.789
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: the mock inclusion list. So we're building a mock inclusion list and then checking how many of those transactions get added into the next block.

127
00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:15.569
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: And obviously, the IL is not actually being applied, and that's only about 20% of the mock IL with the current mempool data I have.

128
00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:30.679
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: So, I've been trying a bunch of things to filter it out better, but, right now, it still also seems like it's a good idea to just fill the include… the full inclusion list, opposed to only doing sensor transactions.

129
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:38.469
Jihoon: Could you expand a little bit of the censorship detection algorithm?

130
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:48.450
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah, for the censorship detection algorithm, I was just looking at transactions that were valid. They were above the…

131
00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:52.450
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Base fee, and we're also above the top

132
00:24:52.490 --> 00:25:12.379
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: 10 or 25th percentile of priority fees, so we're not looking at, like, bottom-bottom transactions, stuff that should likely be included. I can pull that up now. The average IL was including for those transactions per block for the mock ILs, but it was just a very simple

133
00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:21.530
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: this looks like it should have been valid and put into a block, but it's been sitting in the mempool for 2 plus blocks, I believe, is the current setup.

134
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:26.400
Jihoon: Got it. Right.

135
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:33.879
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: And hopefully by next time, I'll have this ran up so it's not just me talking at everyone.

136
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:42.430
Jihoon: Yeah, that makes sense, yeah, great. Maybe we can also have… simulate various

137
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:47.379
Jihoon: Intentionally building algorithm, and then see how it affects the research.

138
00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:49.560
Jihoon: I mean…

139
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.110
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: I was thinking, yeah.

140
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:56.089
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah. Yeah, it would definitely be possible and pretty easy to, like, add on top of this, but yeah.

141
00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.160
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Definitely for the future.

142
00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:07.550
Jihoon: Yeah, yeah, we'd love to see if delaying it by one slot would give us

143
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:16.700
Jihoon: much network bandwidth saved, so… Yeah, it's a great research, I think, so… and thanks for the update.

144
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:25.600
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah, and on the network bandwidth, you're looking at… yeah…

145
00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:30.610
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: About 20% saved, because you can…

146
00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.620
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Wait, sorry. Wait, never mind. Let me think about that for a second.

147
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:42.010
Jihoon: Yeah, because… I, I think that network… Bandwidth save is…

148
00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:46.920
Jihoon: 0.1%, according to your current data.

149
00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:50.040
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah. Because that's what we… yeah, yeah.

150
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.160
Jihoon: So, yeah.

151
00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:52.739
Jihoon: Yeah, we'll see.

152
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:53.830
Jihoon: Yeah.

153
00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.719
Jihoon: Looking forward to the update.

154
00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:59.650
Jihoon: In the next breakout call. Thank you.

155
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.009
Jihoon: Alright, do we have any other updates?

156
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.069
Jihoon: Alright, Ethan.

157
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.309
Jihoon: We can just go ahead and wrap this call.

158
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:39.500
Jihoon: Yeah, thank you guys for joining. Hope you guys have a great rest of your day, and see you guys in two weeks. Thank you!

159
00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:41.960
Katya: Thank you, bye.

160
00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:43.189
Mehdi Aouadi: Thank you, bud.

161
00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:44.950
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Thanks.
