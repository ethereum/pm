# Running a Breakout call
## When to start a breakout

Breakout calls are organized via issues in the ethereum/pm Github repo and you, as the call facilitator, are responsible for getting the right people to attend. Start a breakout if:

- there’s active development / implementation work or open questions to address, and
- it can’t fit responsibly in the ACD agenda
- there’s enough interest that multiple participants will attend

## Configuring a breakout call series

### Concise instructions (verbose below)

1. Contact the Protocol Support team. Provide title, cadence, reason for breakout, associated EIP(s), target fork (if relevant) & your Github username. Wait for Protocol Support to confirm creation.
2. Scheduling the first meeting: create an issue in the [pm repo](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues), choose `Protocol Call`. Use the template to create the issue. Recommended settings:

    - Call Series: your series
    - Duration: 60 minutes
    - Occurrence: if cadence is definite, choose weekly/biweekly/monthly. If not yet known, choose 'other'.
    - Use Custom Meeting Link: ☐ (No) | must have someone with @ethereum.org email present
        - ☒ (Yes) 
    - Display Zoom Link in Calendar Invite: ☒ (Yes)
    - Create Youtube livestream link: ☐ (No)

### Verbose instructions

1. **Contact Protocol Support**
    - **Josh** (`@joshdavislight` on Discord / Telegram, `josh.davis@ethereum.org` by email) or
    - **nixo** (`@nixo.eth` on Discord, `nixo@ethereum.org` by email)
    
    Provide: title, cadence, reason for the breakout, associated EIP(s), target fork (if relevant), & your Github username. Wait for Protocol Support to confirm creation.
    
    **Zoom premium features**: You can use your own zoom meeting or you can use the EF zoom-bot to create the zoom link. The benefit of the EF zoom-bot is that it provides transcripts, an AI summary, and youtube video upload.
    
    *note: because of Zoom’s limitations, use of the EF zoom-bot is limited to calls where you expect to have someone with an @ethereum.org email address present to be assigned the host role. If no one from the EF regularly attends the calls, feel free to send a google drive link to Protocol Support for Youtube upload - please do this RIGHT AFTER THE CALL.*
    
2. Scheduling the first meeting
    
    Once Protocol Support has added support for your breakout series, head to the [pm repo issues](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues), create a `New issue` and choose `Protocol Call`. Use the template to create the issue. Check that:
    
    - [ ]  Title is formatted correctly: <call name> <call #>, <call date>
    - [ ]  UTC Date & Time is correct: Jan 1, 2025, 14:00 UTC
    - [ ]  Call Series: your call series should be in the dropdown
    - [ ]  Choose 60 or 90 minutes
    - [ ]  Occurrence: this affects the EF Protocol calendar event. If you’d like a recurring event on the EF Protocol Calendar, choose weekly/biweekly or monthly. If you’re not sure when the next call will be, choose “other”
    - [ ]  “Use Custom Meeting Link”: check this box if you don’t want to use the EF zoom-bot. No recordings, summaries, transcripts will be provided
    - [ ]  “Display Zoom Link in Calendar Invite”: checking this box is recommended unless you want finer-grained control over who attends the meeting
    - [ ]  “Youtube Livestream Link”: check this if you expect to have someone present at your meeting who can run streaming software (e.g. OBS or Streamyard) and has access to a Youtube stream key. Protocol Support or Ethereum Cat Herders can support if needed. This option is not recommended for small breakouts.
