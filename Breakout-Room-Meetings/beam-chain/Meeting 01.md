| 01.3 | **Protocol Guild Updates** New rule changes require Protocol Guild members to work full-time on Layer 1 research and development. A formal funding proposal will need to be submitted and voted upon by the Protocol Guild DAO. |
| 01.4 | **Legal Challenges** Team is facing trademark issues with the name 'beam', which has resulted in a cease and desist notice. Decision made to change the project name, with Ladislaus tasked to gather community suggestions for a new name. |
| 01.5 | **Researcher Introductions** EF Researchers that are working to coordinate beam chain-related research efforts. On the Cryptography side of things: Dmitry and Benedikt. On the Staking side of things: Anders (along with Ansgar and Caspar) and Francesco. On the Block Production side of things: Thomas and Julian. |
| 01.6 | **ZKVM Development** A $20 million formal verification effort is being led by Alex Hicks as part of the ZKVM accelerationism initiative. The initiative aims to enhance Ethereum's security and scalability. |
| 01.7 | **Zeam Team Introduction: Client Development Team** 2025 mission includes developing a proof of concept to validate basic state transition functions. Focus on integrating with various zkVMs and ensuring seamless client POC functionality. Zeam becomes the first team to receive grant funding. Plans announced to distribute more grants throughout the year. |
| 01.8 | **Ream Labs Introduction** Formed in December 2022, ReamLabs has been developing foundational Rust code. 2025 plans focus on P2P layer development, state transition purification, and implementing post on-time signatures in Q3/Q4. |
