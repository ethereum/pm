### Meeting Info

- Agenda: [ethereum#1248](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1248#issue-2788186304)
- Date & Time: January 27, 2025, 12:00 UTC

## Notes
### Summary 
## Prototype and Development Progress  

## Estimate Gas Prototype  
- Plan to start working on the Estimate Gas prototype soon.  
- Progress on the tracing simulation prototype, discussed in a previous meeting, has stalled due to unforeseen circumstances.  
- NetherMind had committed to developing this prototype but has not yet completed it.  

## Hive Test  
- The team is still working on getting the Hive test operational.  
- No significant progress has been made on simulation strategies, and no decisions have been finalized yet.  

## Feedback Challenges with Node Providers  
- Expressed concern with node providers who provide feedback only after development is complete, rather than during the process.  
- This has led to inefficiencies and rework.  
- The team hopes for more proactive engagement from node providers in the future.  

## Meeting Frequency Discussion  
- The team discussed whether to switch from weekly to bi-weekly meetings.  
  - Some members supported bi-weekly meetings to save time.  
  - Others preferred weekly meetings to maintain a tight feedback loop, especially as prototyping and development efforts ramp up.  
- **Decision:** The team will keep weekly meetings for now, with the option to revisit the decision later.  

## ETH Simulate v2 (or ETH Estimate Simulate)  
- The team acknowledged that ongoing meetings are necessary due to plans for ETH Simulate v2 (or a similar feature).  
- However, the current meetings often feel lengthy without significant progress being made.  
- This weekâ€™s meeting concluded with no major updates or breakthroughs.  

## Action Items  

### Meeting Frequency  
- Continue with weekly meetings for now, with the possibility of switching to bi-weekly meetings in the future if circumstances allow.  

### Prototype Development  
- Continue tracking progress on the Estimate Gas and tracing simulation prototypes.  
- Focus on completing the Hive test and finalizing simulation strategies.  

### Node Provider Engagement  
- Aim to improve communication with node providers to ensure feedback is provided during the development process rather than after.  

### Next Steps  
- Reassess meeting frequency if progress slows or workloads change.  
- Continue development efforts on the Estimate Gas prototype and Hive test.  
- Address feedback challenges with node providers to streamline development processes.
