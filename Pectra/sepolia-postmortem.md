# Sepolia Pectra Incident Post-Mortem

Author: Mario Havel

Status: Resolved

Date: Mar 12, 2025, 18:00 UTC

## Current Status 

The Sepolia testnet has fully recovered from the incident that occurred during the Pectra upgrade on March 5, 2025. Following quick identification of the issue, client teams coordinated a response, first mitigating continuous efforts of the attacker while developing and deploying fixes. Within hours of the incident, later the same day, the network was again operating normally, processing transactions, building blocks and finalizing. 

## Incident overview

On March 5, 2025, at 7:29 UTC (epoch 222464), the Pectra network upgrade was activated on the Sepolia testnet. Shortly after activation, validators began experiencing issues with transaction inclusion, resulting in the production of empty blocks. The issue was specifically related to Sepolia's permissioned deposit contract and its interaction with EIP-6110, which changes how validator deposits are handled. Sepolia runs a permissioned validator set gated by a custom ERC-20 token for deposits, instead of regular ETH. EL clients processing events from the deposit contract ran into issues when the contract emitted unexpected ERC-20 related logs. While fixing the problem, an attacker was actively pushing transactions triggering the issue. Core teams prepared the fix and coordinated release while replacing malicious transactions causing empty blocks. The coordinated rollout happened at 14:00 UTC and successfully mitigated any further issues.

> Note that this issue was specific to Sepolia's testnet configuration and could not occur on the Ethereum mainnet.

Despite the incident, the network:
- Never lost finality
- Continued to produce blocks (though empty)
- Was fully restored within approximately 6.5 hours after the issue occurred

## Incident response and fixes

A high-level overview timeline of the incident, a detailed timeline based on developer chat logs is available below.

### Issue identified after Pectra fork (7:30 - 10:30 UTC)

Pectra was activated on epoch 222464, 7:29 UTC. Shortly after, developers and PandaOps noticed empty blocks. Client logs and block tracing revealed issues with processing the custom deposit contract. Teams joined an emergency call, discussed fixes and determined that an uncoordinated rollout would cause a chain split, so they scheduled an update together for 14:00 UTC.

### Fix preparation and attack mitigation (10:30 - 14:00 UTC)

Client teams started to implement fixes in their client. Felix from the go-ethereum team developed a simple fix that ignored erroneous logs coming from the deposit contract. However, during this time, the attacker sending malicious transactions and triggering the issue was still active. Meanwhile, PandaOps actively replaced the triggering transactions with higher-paying ones to allow full block production. However, it's assumed the attacker actually read the public developer channel so some fixes were discussed in private. The attacker could still send transactions to the deposit contract and constantly trigger issues because ERC-20 allows a zero token transfer. The temporary fix was developed in private and deployed to EF DevOps nodes (~10% of network). This allowed at least those nodes to propose full blocks until the coordinated deployment of the fix. 

### Coordinated Deployment (14:00 UTC)

At 14:00 UTC, developers joined another coordination call and all nodes were updated with new client releases containing the proper fix. This was confirmed successful, the chain continued to be stable with regular blocks and previously problematic transactions were included without further issues. 

## Client Releases

Client teams released versions containing hot fixes for the Sepolia issue. All node operators must upgrade their execution layer clients to follow Sepolia:

- Besu: [v25.2.2](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/releases/tag/25.2.2)
- Erigon: [v3.0.0-rc3](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/releases/tag/v3.0.0-rc3), [v2.61.3](https://github.com/erigontech/erigon/releases/tag/v2.61.3)
- Geth: [v1.15.5](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.15.5)
- Nethermind: [v1.31.4](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/releases/tag/1.31.4)
- Reth: [v1.2.2](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v1.2.2)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Execution Layer Issue

The issue occurred in the execution layer because of the incompatibility between EIP-6110 implementation and Sepolia's custom deposit contract. Unlike mainnet or Hole≈°ky, Sepolia validation is permissioned which is achieved by using a token-gated deposit contract based on ERC-20 tokens instead of ETH.

When a deposit was sent to test the execution-triggered withdrawal functionality, execution clients encountered an error: "unable to parse deposit data: deposit wrong length: want 576, have 32". This is because the deposit contract emitted ERC-20 transfer events that are not part of a regular contract and were not expected by the EIP-6110 implementation logic. The failed events parsing invalidated blocks containing transactions to deposit, forcing validators to produce empty blocks.

An important obstacle of the fixing process was the ongoing attack triggering the issue. Because ERC-20 allows zero token transfers, which can be initiated by anyone, even without owning the token, the attacker could still send malicious transactions that emit incorrect events in the contract. 

### Root Cause Remediations

- Execution clients implemented a fix for parsing deposit contract logs, e.g. Geth [#31317](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31317)
- EIP-6110 is updated to add events filtering
- Blockchain tests are updated to cover related scenarios

### Further Mitigations and Learnings

The testnet configuration needs to more closely mirror mainnet, reducing testnet-specific edge cases. Custom deposit contract proved to be a bigger problem than expected.

ABI decoding of contract events needs to be more resilient and fault tolerant. More discussion is happening on ABI decoding libraries. 

Besu team used a plugin system that allows deploying quick temporary hot fix, excluding malicious transactions, without requiring a full release. They are also going to review usage of third-party libraries in critical consensus paths.

Geth noticed that they did not have a override flag for Cancun yet, fixed in [#31341](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31341)

## Timeline of Events

_Note: LLM was used to compile this based on the Discord chat transcript. I've sanity checked most of it, but there may be slight inaccuracies._

Because of mitigating an active attacker, some fixes were not discussed publicly and only happened in private chat between developers.
