# [Active] Holesky Pectra Incident Post-Mortem

Author: Tim Beiko 

Status: Active

Date: Feb 27, 2025, 17:30 UTC

# Current Status and Next Steps

Client teams are still trying to recover the Holesky network. 

## Holesky Coordinated Slashings

On [ACDE#206](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1306), client teams decided to try and coordinate mass Holesky slashings around slot `3737760` (Feb 28, 15:12:00 UTC). Ideally, the nework would have enough validators online to finalize an epoch on the valid chain at the same time. If successful, this will help clients sync to the minority chain. While all slashings and exits will still need to be processed, and Holesky is expected to go through other longs period of non-finality, a finalized epoch will make it easier to peer with nodes on the valid chain. 

Holesky operators should now:

1. Update their clients to the versions listed below
2. Sync their validators to the head of the chain
3. Be ready to disable slashing protection by slot `3737760` (Feb 28, 15:12:00 UTC)

Instructions to disable slashing protection for each client can be found below. A call will be hosted from 15:00-16:00 UTC for client teams and node operators to coordinate on this: https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1337

### Disabling Slashing Protection 

Instructions for how to disable slashing protection per client. 

**Grandine**

TBA

**Lodestar**
1. Stop validator client
2. `rm -r <dataDir>/validator-db`
3. Start validator client

**Lighthouse**

See https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/7040

**Nimbus**

TBA

**Prysm**

Add the following CLI argument to the validator client **and NOT to the beacon node** and restart the validator client **and NOT the beacon node**: `--force-clear-db`

# Root Cause Analysis

## Execution Layer Issue 

The root cause of the initial problem was that several execution clients (Geth, Nethermind, and Besu) had incorrect deposit contract addresses configured for the Holesky testnet. Specifically:

- Holesky's deposit contract address should be `0x4242424242424242424242424242424242424242`
- Some EL clients were using the mainnet deposit contract address or had no specific configuration for Holesky, leading them to use `0x0000...0000` 

When a block containing a deposit transaction was proposed at slot 3711006 (block 3419724), these clients processed it with an empty requests list, resulting in an incorrect requests hash. This caused a network split where:

- Erigon and Reth correctly rejected the invalid block
- Geth, Nethermind, and Besu accepted the invalid block

The deposit transaction in question can be found at: [https://holesky.etherscan.io/tx/0x48d5201b36db1122ce4d67367d03ad97d7c2e5b497c324843496230859be1bc7/advanced#eventlog](https://holesky.etherscan.io/tx/0x48d5201b36db1122ce4d67367d03ad97d7c2e5b497c324843496230859be1bc7/advanced#eventlog)

## Consensus Layer Issue

Once the network split occurred, a secondary issue emerged: consensus clients had difficulty syncing to the correct chain. This was due to:

1. The majority of nodes following the invalid chain
2. The invalid chain reaching justified status (though not finalized) in epoch 115968, making it the dominant chain
3. Consensus clients entering "syncing" mode when they couldn't find enough peers on the valid chain
4. Validators not producing blocks while their beacon nodes were in "syncing" mode
5. Slashing protection preventing validators from attesting to the correct chain after having attested to the invalid chain

The justification of the invalid chain created a particularly challenging situation. This justification meant that validators who had attested to the justified checkpoint on the invalid chain would face "surround" slashing conditions if they tried to attest to the correct chain.

This created a negative feedback loop where the valid chain had few blocks and few peers, making it increasingly difficult for nodes to sync to it. The situation was made worse because consensus clients are designed to follow the chain with the most attestation weight, which in this case was the invalid chain.

# Root Cause Remediations

_Note: this is a rough first draft, more to come later._

## User-specified Unfinalized Checkpoint Sync 

Allow CL clients to pick an arbitrary block from which to inialize checkpoint sync, even if not finalized. This would allow users to socially coordinate around a specific chain, forcing the client to sync to it. To be discussed further on March 6's ACDC call. 

## Validate EL fork parameterization 

Implement a form of validation for EL parameters introduced or changed in a network upgrade, either statically or as part of the peer-to-peer protocol. A telegram group has been created to discuss the issue: https://t.me/+d8rLI1WcaY41MmY5 

# Timeline of Events

_Note: I used an LLM to compile this based on the Discord chat transcript. I've sanity checked most of it, but there may be slight inaccuracies._

## February 26, 2025

### 00:00-06:00 UTC: Increased Validator Participation 
- 00:15: Jim (Attestant) shares modified Vouch client: `attestant/vouch:unsynced`
- 02:15: Jimmy Chen clarifies the purpose of Lighthouse's `disable-attesting` flag:
  > "`disable-attesting` is mainly used to avoid flooding the BN so it can sync without struggling with attestation requests."
- 02:42: Prysm team confirms their validators are online
- 03:14: Obol team brings 10K validator cluster online
- 03:48: Chainsafe confirms all 100K Lodestar keys are proposing blocks
- 04:56: EF DevOps brings all 40K validators online
- 05:42: Nimbus team shares instructions for removing slashing protection:
  > "for nimbus-eth2, it's `<dataDir>/db/slashing_protection.sqlite3`. also restart the beacon node so that it forgets about the fake-valid engine response from the broken EL versions."

### 06:00-14:30 UTC: Strategy Refinement 
- 07:46: Discussion about how to disable slashing protection for each client
- 08:24: Grandine team shares instructions: "For Grandine you need to remove slashing protection DB by running `rm ~/.grandine/holesky/validator/slashing_protection*`"
- 09:54: Confirmation that approximately 5-8 blocks per epoch are being produced (15-25% of target)
- 10:22: Nethermind snapshot shared at block 3420120
- 10:40: Besu team brings another 40K validators online
- 11:27: Confirmation that ~15K Nethermind validators have been slashed
- 11:50: Potuz emphasizes: "we need the blocks much more than the attestations, I thought we had clearly agreed to stabilize the chain before attesting. Any attestation takes out all the blocks from that validator that could support the chain"
- 12:01: Potuz provides clear recovery strategy:
  > "The summary is very simple:
  > 	1. Sync nodes
  > 	2. Enable validators
  > 	3. Do not remove slashing db
  > 	That's it."
- 12:34: Potuz provides detailed explanation for the strategy:
  > "Nodes run more smoothly when there are blocks in the chain, when a block is not there we start hitting cache misses and need to start applying heuristics because the block may have been there and we didn't see it. The chain can pack more attestations when there are more blocks in the chain and thus be less forked. Syncing nodes receive more regular updates of their status when there are more blocks in the chain..."
- 12:52: Paul Harris reports: "We've at least got one of our teku / besu nodes up with 20k keys - all will surround so no attestations, but producing blocks."
- 13:07: Kamil (Nethermind) reports: "Nethermind slashed 13337 validators so far based on Dora and seems like it is slowing down? Still 80-90% of ours slots are proposing blocks well"
- 13:16: Grandine team reports successful recovery with Nethermind
- 14:00: [Holesky Incident Debrief call takes place](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/holesky-incident-debrief-february-26-2025/22998
- 14:29: Marek (Nethermind) creates Hackmd document to track validator status: [https://hackmd.io/zu-FVVBSQr-GPdfh4UUIdQ](https://hackmd.io/zu-FVVBSQr-GPdfh4UUIdQ)

### 14:30 UTC - cont'd: Network Health Improvement
- 15:43: Terence reports significant improvement: "I'm actually syncing really smoothly on my local node now, everything from scratch (geth - prysm). Following blocks from 6 hours ago. Having Dora alive makes this really easy. I'm impressed how much more smoother everything is today comparing to yesterday"
- 17:33: Discussion about long-term recovery plan, estimating 18 days until finalization
- 19:09: Marius estimates Holesky is getting 10% attestations participation and 30-50% of scheduled block proposals.
